# Orama Streaming Persistence Implementation

## Problem
- Orama's built-in persistence plugin has a 512MB limit due to JavaScript string length limits
- Current approach fails with "Invalid string length" error when serializing large indexes
- Our index has 380K+ search entries (~5GB in memory) which exceeds the string limit

## Solution: Streaming Persistence with MsgPack
Based on prototype from: https://github.com/oramasearch/orama/issues/851#issuecomment-2888461388

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Setup Dependencies âœ…
- âœ… Checked @msgpack/msgpack availability (v3.1.2 installed)
- âœ… Added compression support (gzip only - zstd requires external package)

#### Phase 2: Create Streaming Persistence Functions âœ…
- âœ… `persistToFileStreaming()` - replaces `serializeOramaIndex()`
- âœ… `restoreFromFileStreaming()` - for reading back the index
- âœ… Support compression options: none, gzip (zstd removed due to Node.js limitations)

#### Phase 3: Update Database Module âœ…
- âœ… Replace `serializeOramaIndex()` with streaming approach
- âœ… Use Orama's `save()` function instead of `persist()`
- âœ… Return file path instead of Buffer
- âœ… Export new functions and types

#### Phase 4: Update SRT Indexing Lambda âœ…
- âœ… Modify to use new streaming persistence
- âœ… Update file handling logic for S3 upload
- âœ… Build completed successfully

#### Phase 5: Testing âœ… COMPLETED
- âœ… **myfavoritemurder dataset (380K entries)**: SUCCESS! 
  - Persisted 152.20 MB compressed file
  - Memory peaked at ~5GB but stayed well under limits
  - No string length errors
  - S3 upload successful
- âœ… **claretandblue dataset (206K entries)**: SUCCESS after MsgPack depth fix
  - Fixed by increasing MsgPack `maxDepth` to 1000
  - Error resolved: "Too deep objects in depth 101"
- âœ… **naddpod dataset (236K entries)**: SUCCESS!
  - Persisted 90.81 MB compressed file
  - Memory peaked at ~2.7GB
  - Processing time: 26.16 seconds total

#### Phase 6: Search Lambda Integration (FINAL PHASE)
- ðŸ”„ **Update search lambda to use streaming restoration**
  - Replace `deserializeOramaIndex()` with `restoreFromFileStreaming()`
  - Handle gzip-compressed files correctly
  - Test search functionality with new file format
- ðŸ”„ **Verify end-to-end search workflow**
  - Confirm persisted indexes load correctly in search lambda
  - Test actual search queries work as expected
  - Validate performance is maintained

## âœ… Edge Case Resolved: MsgPack Depth Limit

**Solution Applied**: Increased MsgPack `maxDepth` from default 100 to 1000 levels

**Root Cause**: Different Orama index structures create varying tree depths based on:
- Text tokenization patterns (shorter vs longer text segments)
- Search tree branching factors
- Internal index organization

**Impact**: All tested sites now work successfully:
- **myfavoritemurder**: 380K entries â†’ 152.20 MB
- **naddpod**: 236K entries â†’ 90.81 MB  
- **claretandblue**: 206K entries â†’ (size TBD after rerun)

## Key Benefits
- No string length limits (streaming approach)
- Better compression (MsgPack + gzip/zstd)
- Lower memory usage during serialization
- Proven to work with large datasets

## Implementation Notes
- Using MsgPack for binary serialization (more efficient than JSON)
- Streaming prevents large string creation
- Compression reduces final file size significantly
- zstd offers best compression ratio + speed balance
