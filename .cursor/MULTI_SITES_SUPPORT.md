# Background

This repository, up to this point, has only deployed a single application, at a single domain: listenfairplay.com. That site currently handles indexing & searching for 2 podcast feeds:
1. `football-cliches`
2. `for-our-sins-the-cliches-pod-archive`

These are defined in `/Users/jackkoppa/Personal_Development/browse-dot-show/packages/config/rss-config.ts`

Those 2 feeds represent the same essential podcast (one is the old feed, one the current one).
That site is working great, and has been for a few weeks.

Now, it's time to update this repository to be able to support a few more deployed "sites" (each of these for archiving & searching one podcast each). And, crucially, for other people to be able to clone this repository, and after providing their own `/Users/jackkoppa/Personal_Development/browse-dot-show/sites/my-sites/` - which includes their own AWS SSO account where the application infrastructure will be deployed - other people will be able to run/host their *own* sites, for the podcast(s) in which they're most interested.

So there's a *lot* of abstracting we're going to have to do. Most complex might be updating Terraform variable files, so that we can deploy an arbitrary number of different sites - and have all their application infrastructure tagged with the appropriate `site` `id`. Some of these `sites` may be deployed in the same AWS root account. **But many `sites` will be deployed in completely separate AWS accounts**, and that needs to be supported as well.

Similarly, there are likely a few (not too many, but some) places in the client-facing React code that are currently _Football Clich√©s_-specific. We'll want to update those places to use the relevant config values from `sites`.

For now, we're still not implementing CI/CD - all deploys will continue to be performed from the local CLI of whomever has cloned the repo and/or its fork. 

But that means that many different scripts will need to be updated to:
* likely provide a default .env `ENV_VARIABLE_SOME_NAME` - that is the default selected site, that commands (including existing local `pnpm` commands, and also `deploy.sh`-style commands) should apply to
* Prompt the user before running the command if they want to _switch_ to have it apply to a different `/sites` option

Especially important for deployment. But also for all the other scripts, like `pnpm client:dev` or `pnpm process-audio-lambda:run:local`

Again: currently, only `listenfairplay.com` is currently working. But we have already tested the various `pnpm` commands on 3 other `sites` in advance, so that we have all the downloaded `audio`, `transcripts`, and `search-entries` files for those, and we'll be ready to start testing each once the repo has been adjusted to support multi-sites.

Those basic config files have now already been created. See: `/Users/jackkoppa/Personal_Development/browse-dot-show/sites/origin-sites/README.md`

The task here is to carefully & deliberately plan out implementation for adding this multi-sites support. Eventually, we will implement that together.

Important: take your time going through **all** directories near the top level in this repo, to make sure you understand the full context.

Expecially important:
* `/Users/jackkoppa/Personal_Development/browse-dot-show/packages/client/`
* `/Users/jackkoppa/Personal_Development/browse-dot-show/packages/ingestion/`
* `/Users/jackkoppa/Personal_Development/browse-dot-show/packages/s3/`
* `/Users/jackkoppa/Personal_Development/browse-dot-show/packages/search/`
* `/Users/jackkoppa/Personal_Development/browse-dot-show/scripts/`
* `/Users/jackkoppa/Personal_Development/browse-dot-show/sites/`
* `/Users/jackkoppa/Personal_Development/browse-dot-show/terraform/`
