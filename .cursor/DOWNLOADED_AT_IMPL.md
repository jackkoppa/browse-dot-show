# Downloaded-At Implementation Plan

## Current System Understanding

### Current File Structure
- **Episode Manifest**: `/episode-manifest/full-episode-manifest.json` 
- **Audio Files**: `audio/{podcastId}/{fileKey}.mp3`
- **Transcripts**: `transcripts/{podcastId}/{fileKey}.srt`
- **Search Entries**: `search-entries/{podcastId}/{fileKey}.json`

### Current File Key Format
- Pattern: `{YYYY-MM-DD}_{sanitized-title}`
- Example: `2024-07-25_Simple-Episode-Title`
- Generated by: `getEpisodeFileKey()` in `packages/ingestion/rss-retrieval-lambda/utils/get-episode-file-key.ts`

### Current Title Sanitization (Inadequate)
```typescript
const sanitizedTitle = episodeTitle
    .normalize('NFC')
    .replace(/[/\\?%*:|"<>.]/g, '-')
    .replace(/\s+/g, '-')
    .substring(0, 50);
```

## Problem Statement

1. **Timing Mismatch**: Audio files downloaded locally vs. Lambda can have different ads
2. **File Tracking**: No way to know WHEN a file was downloaded
3. **Inadequate Sanitization**: Unicode chars, symbols like `+` cause issues
4. **File Consistency**: Need to ensure transcript/search-entry match their audio file

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Enhanced File Key Format
- **New Pattern**: `{YYYY-MM-DD}_{sanitized-title}--{unix-timestamp}`
- **Example**: `2024-07-25_Simple-Episode-Title--1721909640000`
- **Benefits**: Unique per download, chronologically sortable, matches exactly, easy to visually scan

### 2. Improved Title Sanitization
- **Allow Only**: Letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), underscores (_)
- **Replace Everything Else**: With underscores
- **Example**: `"Café & Naïve + More!"` → `"Cafe_Naive_More_"`

### 3. Enhanced Episode Manifest
Add new field to `EpisodeInManifest`:
```typescript
export interface EpisodeInManifest {
    // ... existing fields ...
    downloadedAt?: string; // ISO 8601 timestamp when audio was downloaded
}
```

## Implementation Notes

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: When updating things in `/packages`, always run `pnpm all:build` before using/testing those utils in other packages to update types, etc. Use `pnpm` throughout the project.

- **Root Cause**: Title variations (trailing spaces) in multi-podcast RSS feeds
- **Solution**: Added title normalization (`.trim()`) to duplicate detection logic
- **Result**: Successfully cleaned up 271 duplicate episodes, keeping versions with transcripts
- **Final State**: 716 → 445 episodes (271 duplicates removed), 0 duplicate versions remaining

**📝 Sample Migrated Files:**
- **Before**: `2022-09-27_What's-a-Hard-Fork-.mp3`
- **After**: `2022-09-27_What_s_a_Hard_Fork--1749472638931.mp3`
- **Manifest**: Added `"downloadedAt": "2025-06-09T12:37:18.931Z"`

**✅ PHASE 4 COMPLETION VALIDATED:**
```bash
# All sites now show 0 duplicate issues:

## Detailed File Changes

### 1. Type Definition Updates

```typescript
// packages/types/episode-manifest.ts
export interface EpisodeInManifest {
    sequentialId: number;
    podcastId: PodcastId;
    title: string;
    fileKey: string; // Will now include downloadedAt timestamp
    originalAudioURL: string;
    summary: string;
    durationInSeconds?: number;
    publishedAt: string; // ISO 8601 date string
    downloadedAt?: string; // NEW: ISO 8601 timestamp when audio was downloaded
    hasCompletedLLMAnnotations: boolean;
    llmAnnotations: LlmAnnotations;
}
```

### 2. Enhanced File Key Generation

```typescript
// packages/ingestion/rss-retrieval-lambda/utils/get-episode-file-key.ts

function sanitizeTitleStrict(title: string): string {
    return title
        .normalize('NFC') // Normalize Unicode
        .replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g, '_') // Replace non-alphanumeric with underscore
        .replace(/_+/g, '_') // Replace multiple underscores with single
        .replace(/^_|_$/g, '') // Remove leading/trailing underscores
        .substring(0, 50); // Limit length
}

export function getEpisodeFileKeyWithDownloadedAt(
    episodeTitle: string, 
    pubDateStr: string, 
    downloadedAt: Date
): string {
    const date = parsePubDate(pubDateStr);
    const formattedDate = formatDateYYYYMMDD(date);
    const downloadedAtUnix = downloadedAt.getTime();
    const sanitizedTitle = sanitizeTitleStrict(episodeTitle);
    
    return `${formattedDate}_${sanitizedTitle}--${downloadedAtUnix}`;
}

// Backwards compatibility
export function getEpisodeFileKey(episodeTitle: string, pubDateStr: string): string {
    // Keep old behavior for migration compatibility
    const date = parsePubDate(pubDateStr);
    const formattedDate = formatDateYYYYMMDD(date);
    const sanitizedTitle = episodeTitle
        .normalize('NFC')
        .replace(/[/\\?%*:|"<>.]/g, '-')
        .replace(/\s+/g, '-')
        .substring(0, 50);
    return `${formattedDate}_${sanitizedTitle}`;
}

// Utility to check if file key has downloadedAt timestamp
export function hasDownloadedAtTimestamp(fileKey: string): boolean {
    return fileKey.includes('--') && /--\d{13}$/.test(fileKey);
}

// Extract downloadedAt from file key
export function extractDownloadedAtFromFileKey(fileKey: string): Date | null {
    const match = fileKey.match(/--(\d{13})$/);
    if (match) {
        return new Date(parseInt(match[1]));
    }
    return null;
}
```

### 3. RSS Retrieval Lambda Updates

```typescript
// packages/ingestion/rss-retrieval-lambda/retrieve-rss-feeds-and-download-audio-files.ts

// When creating new episode entries
const downloadedAt = new Date();
const newEpisodeToAdd: EpisodeInManifest = {
    sequentialId: 0,
    podcastId,
    title: episodeTitle,
    fileKey: getEpisodeFileKeyWithDownloadedAt(episodeTitle, pubDateString, downloadedAt),
    originalAudioURL,
    summary,
    durationInSeconds,
    publishedAt: parsedPublishedDate.toISOString(),
    downloadedAt: downloadedAt.toISOString(), // NEW FIELD
    hasCompletedLLMAnnotations: false,
    llmAnnotations: {},
};

// Add cleanup logic for older files
async function cleanupOlderVersions(episodeManifest: EpisodeManifest, podcastId: string): Promise<void> {
    // Group episodes by originalAudioURL to find duplicates
    const episodesByUrl = new Map<string, EpisodeInManifest[]>();
    
    episodeManifest.episodes
        .filter(ep => ep.podcastId === podcastId)
        .forEach(ep => {
            if (!episodesByUrl.has(ep.originalAudioURL)) {
                episodesByUrl.set(ep.originalAudioURL, []);
            }
            episodesByUrl.get(ep.originalAudioURL)!.push(ep);
        });
    
    // For each URL, keep only the newest downloadedAt version
    for (const [url, episodes] of episodesByUrl) {
        if (episodes.length > 1) {
            // Sort by downloadedAt, keep newest
            episodes.sort((a, b) => {
                const aTime = a.downloadedAt ? new Date(a.downloadedAt).getTime() : 0;
                const bTime = b.downloadedAt ? new Date(b.downloadedAt).getTime() : 0;
                return bTime - aTime; // Newest first
            });
            
            const [newest, ...older] = episodes;
            
            // Delete older files and remove from manifest
            for (const oldEpisode of older) {
                await deleteEpisodeFiles(oldEpisode, podcastId);
                const index = episodeManifest.episodes.indexOf(oldEpisode);
                if (index >= 0) {
                    episodeManifest.episodes.splice(index, 1);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

async function deleteEpisodeFiles(episode: EpisodeInManifest, podcastId: string): Promise<void> {
    const audioPath = path.join(getAudioDirPrefix(), podcastId, `${episode.fileKey}.mp3`);
    const transcriptPath = path.join(getTranscriptsDirPrefix(), podcastId, `${episode.fileKey}.srt`);
    const searchEntryPath = path.join(getSearchEntriesDirPrefix(), podcastId, `${episode.fileKey}.json`);
    
    try {
        if (await fileExists(audioPath)) await deleteFile(audioPath);
        if (await fileExists(transcriptPath)) await deleteFile(transcriptPath);
        if (await fileExists(searchEntryPath)) await deleteFile(searchEntryPath);
        log.info(`Deleted older version files for: ${episode.fileKey}`);
    } catch (error) {
        log.error(`Error deleting files for ${episode.fileKey}:`, error);
    }
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests
- Test new file key generation functions
- Test title sanitization with various inputs
- Test downloadedAt extraction from file keys

### 2. Integration Tests  
- Test full pipeline with new file format
- Test cleanup logic with multiple versions
- Test backfill script with sample data

### 3. Migration Testing
- Test backwards compatibility with existing files
- Test gradual migration of one site
- Validate file consistency after migration

## Risk Mitigation

### 1. Simplified Migration
- Support current format during backfill only
- Clean slate approach: delete S3 assets and sync from corrected local files
- No rollback needed due to no user impact

### 2. Data Integrity
- Comprehensive validation before and after migration
- Backup existing files before modification
- Detailed logging of all changes

### 3. Performance Impact
- Minimize disruption during migration
- Efficient cleanup algorithms
- Monitor Lambda execution times

## Questions & Considerations

1. **Phase 2 Completion Strategy**: Should we complete Phase 2.2 and 2.3 immediately, or test Phase 2.1 in isolation first?
2. **Migration Timeline**: Should we migrate all sites at once or one by one?
3. **Cleanup Strategy**: Should we immediately delete older files or keep them for a grace period?
4. **File Size Comparison**: How much size difference should trigger a re-download?
5. **Error Recovery**: How should we handle partial failures during cleanup?
6. **Monitoring**: What metrics should we track during and after migration?

**⚠️ URGENT PHASE 2 QUESTION**: 
Should we proceed immediately with Phase 2.2 (Process Audio Lambda) and 2.3 (SRT Indexing Lambda) to complete the downloadedAt implementation across all lambdas, or would you prefer to test the RSS Retrieval Lambda changes first?

A: Proceed to 2.2 & 2.3. Passing unit tests is sufficient for now.
