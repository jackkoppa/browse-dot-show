# Transcripts Directory

This directory will store SRT transcript files generated by OpenAI's Whisper API.

Note: eventually, all files currently in `/processing/transcripts` will instead be in an S3 bucket. At that point, scripts will be updated accordingly, and this directory will be used only for local development.

The file naming convention matches the audio files: YYYY-MM-DD_[sanitized-episode-title].srt
