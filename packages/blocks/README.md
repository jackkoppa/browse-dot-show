# blocks

Any shared layout / functional components, and styles, shared by [`client`](../client/) or [`homepage`](../homepage/)

> [!NOTE]
> `blocks` is *not* for shared shadcn components. Those all live in [`ui`](../ui/), and are added directly there from https://ui.shadcn.com/

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `blocks` is not compiled. Compilation is handled by `client` or `homepage`, so both of those applications import `blocks` directly
