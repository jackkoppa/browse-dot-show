# My Sites

This directory is where you create and configure your own podcast archive sites. This is the primary location for sites in forked repositories.

For example sites and templates, see the [browse-dot-show-example-sites](https://github.com/jackkoppa/browse-dot-show-example-sites) repository (coming soon).

## Create your own site(s)

Use the browse.show Site Creator

```bash
pnpm site:create
```
