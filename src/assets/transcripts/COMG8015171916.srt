1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,080
[SPEAKER_02]: The 2025 NCAA March Madness Men's Tournament is back, and this time it is bringing all the feels.

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:13,500
[SPEAKER_02]: The biggest event in kind of sports tips off March 18th, and you don't want to miss a second of the heart-pumping action.

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:19,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Catch all of the clutch shots, big-time plays, upsets, Cinderella's, Blue Bloods, and more.

4
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:29,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Tune in to the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship March 18th through April 7th on TBS, CBS, TNT, True TV, and Stream on Max.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,820
[SPEAKER_15]: It's perfectly brown, it's melty, it's sweet.

6
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,920
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the s'more you just cooked over the fire at AutoCamp.

7
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:40,660
[SPEAKER_15]: That's right, Hilton brings you new ways to stay, where you don't just get nightly s'mores.

8
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,920
[SPEAKER_15]: You also get clubhouse happy hours to gather under the stars.

9
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,900
[SPEAKER_15]: All while staying in custom-designed airstreams, cabins, and tents, and insanely cool outdoor destinations.

10
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,820
[SPEAKER_15]: If AutoCamp sounds like a dream, it sounds like it's time to redeem those Hilton honors points at Hilton.com.

11
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,540
[SPEAKER_15]: Hilton for the stay.

12
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:03,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Hear that?

13
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Spring is back.

14
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,090
[SPEAKER_02]: And so is Church's seafood.

15
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,810
[SPEAKER_02]: With eight-piece shrimp, surf and turf, or fish sandwich.

16
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Each starting at $3.99.

17
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Offer valid at participating locations.

18
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,510
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, you can sit there and look and play with all your silly machines as much as you like.

19
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:21,810
[SPEAKER_08]: Is Gascoigne going to have a crack?

20
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:22,830
[SPEAKER_08]: He is, you know.

21
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I say!

22
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:51,290
[SPEAKER_10]: He does it time, and time, and time again.

23
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:52,790
[SPEAKER_10]: Crank up the music!

24
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,710
[SPEAKER_10]: Charge a glass!

25
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:58,850
[SPEAKER_14]: This nation is going to dance all night!

26
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,970
[SPEAKER_14]: Woke units of on-pitch measurement.

27
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,370
[SPEAKER_14]: Pro-evo Erling Haaland on pointless.

28
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:08,430
[SPEAKER_14]: Wilfred Zaha confronts some modern footballing discourse head-on.

29
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:11,470
[SPEAKER_14]: Why Patrick Schick refuses to turn provider.

30
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,750
[SPEAKER_14]: Our niche predictions for England versus Albania and Latvia.

31
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,450
[SPEAKER_14]: The Lionel Messi of acting.

32
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:19,530
[SPEAKER_14]: Imagining the joy of discovering football for the first time.

33
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,950
[SPEAKER_14]: Treating your pants drawer like a squad rebuild.

34
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,770
[SPEAKER_14]: The lack of competition for supermarket pizza merchants.

35
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,470
[SPEAKER_14]: And a glorious ice hockey cliches tribute.

36
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,650
[SPEAKER_14]: Brought to your ears by Goalhanger Podcasts.

37
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,410
[SPEAKER_14]: This is Football Clichés.

38
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,920
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello, everyone, and welcome to Football Clichés.

39
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,960
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm Adam Hurry, and with me today, first of all, is Charlie Eccleshare.

40
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,400
[SPEAKER_14]: How are you doing?

41
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,260
[SPEAKER_14]: Very well, thank you.

42
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,820
[SPEAKER_14]: Alongside you is Nick Miller.

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,440
[SPEAKER_14]: How are things?

44
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:46,700
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, very well.

45
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,640
[SPEAKER_14]: Good to have you.

46
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,140
[SPEAKER_14]: Charlie, Salma Binler got in touch on Reddit.

47
00:02:50,220 --> 00:03:02,240
[SPEAKER_14]: He said, I was disappointed that Premier League years enthusiast Charlie couldn't remember Kenny Dalgleish's Newcastle United being referred to by Georgie Thompson as Dalgleish's dad's army on Premier League years.

48
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,220
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's hear a clip of that.

49
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,600
[SPEAKER_14]: Signing on at St. James's Park, Stuart Pearce.

50
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Dalgleish's dad's army, they called it, as Ian Rush and John Barnes were acquired.

51
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,920
[SPEAKER_13]: I was saying on the last episode, I knew there was a Premier League one, and this is perfect.

52
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:29,020
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's even better the fact that it's not just in the moment calling it dad's army, but a year on or whenever this was filmed and recorded to then retrospectively call it a dad's army is even better.

53
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:37,940
[SPEAKER_14]: Also on Tuesday's episode, Nick, we were discussing whether the engine room in midfield relates to the players or the environment in which they're operating.

54
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:47,140
[SPEAKER_14]: We, the consensus was that it was the place, it was the area of midfield in which the players operate that is the engine room and they're just operating in the engine room.

55
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:53,660
[SPEAKER_14]: But Game of Throw-Ins writes in and says, not often I disagree with all three of you, but I'm pretty sure you were off on the engine room discourse.

56
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:58,480
[SPEAKER_14]: Surely the midfielders, normally a two-man midfield, are themselves the engine room of the team.

57
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:07,460
[SPEAKER_12]: I did actually think this as I was listening on Tuesday.

58
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,400
[SPEAKER_12]: You can call two players in midfield, the midfield, can't you?

59
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,000
[SPEAKER_12]: So why not?

60
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,700
[SPEAKER_12]: They can be the engine room.

61
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:20,520
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, by now, Charlie, I'm not averse to being corrected on this podcast, but I couldn't believe how adamant we were that this was the case.

62
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,700
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm glad I didn't go in harder, that's all I'm saying.

63
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,620
[SPEAKER_13]: It is one of those that slightly lost all meaning for me now, though, because we talked about it so much.

64
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,400
[SPEAKER_13]: I now, I can't really even remember.

65
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,660
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I do think I originally, yeah, as I said, I thought it was, and I still kind of think that.

66
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,480
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe it could be either.

67
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,960
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think you do talk about in the engine room, you know, it's one of those, but you want him in the engine room.

68
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,540
[SPEAKER_13]: I can imagine that being said.

69
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,980
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know anymore.

70
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:42,760
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know anymore.

71
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,280
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you would say you want him in the engine room.

72
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,380
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think you necessarily say you want him to be the engine room.

73
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,180
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, okay.

74
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,300
[SPEAKER_13]: To be part of the engine room.

75
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,200
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that would sound weird.

76
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,040
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think you can have a one-man engine room or one-person engine room.

77
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:55,960
[SPEAKER_12]: That's too much.

78
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,000
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, not even N'Golo Kante would be a one-man engine room.

79
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,560
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it's all hands to the pump, isn't it?

80
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,800
[SPEAKER_14]: And you need at least two pairs of hands for the pump.

81
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,640
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, but let's get on to, it's gone to new matters, new territory.

82
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,180
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's wipe the slate clean.

83
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,700
[SPEAKER_14]: This first one came from Amir, who was listening to the Blood Red Liverpool podcast.

84
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,040
[SPEAKER_14]: John Aldridge was the guest.

85
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,200
[SPEAKER_14]: And they were talking about the ongoing struggles of Darwin Nunez.

86
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,980
[SPEAKER_14]: And Aldridge, the game's gone for him in this respect.

87
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:29,440
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the easiest thing for a footballer is to work hard.

88
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,820
[SPEAKER_09]: The hardest thing is to score goals, create goals and play well.

89
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:42,400
[SPEAKER_09]: The easiest thing is to go out there and for like 90 minutes or whatever, run 10 miles or kilometres or whatever they do this day and age.

90
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,180
[SPEAKER_14]: Kilometres are newfangled, apparently.

91
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,140
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a man who's played on the continent, Nick.

92
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,100
[SPEAKER_14]: Woke nonsense.

93
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,860
[SPEAKER_13]: Are kilometres woke, Charlie?

94
00:05:54,980 --> 00:06:06,020
[SPEAKER_13]: It's true that it is slightly odd that kilometres are always the go-to measurement when we see how far footballers have run in this country, when miles would ordinarily outside of football, you know, be the go-to.

95
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:10,660
[SPEAKER_13]: Looks more impressive, Nick, because, you know, you get more kilometres for your buck, don't you?

96
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,480
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but I always kind of overcompensate with it.

97
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,540
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, what is it?

98
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,940
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like fluctuating currency conversions.

99
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:17,760
[SPEAKER_12]: What's that?

100
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,560
[SPEAKER_12]: It's $2 to the pound, isn't it?

101
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:19,880
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

102
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,360
[SPEAKER_12]: No, actually, it's not that anymore.

103
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,760
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really expensive in America these days.

104
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,080
[SPEAKER_12]: Hang on.

105
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,640
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, you're spot on.

106
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,420
[SPEAKER_14]: Kilometres are dollars.

107
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,420
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely right.

108
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,060
[SPEAKER_14]: So in that respect, I do sympathise with John Aldridge.

109
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,420
[SPEAKER_14]: This next one came from Paul.

110
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,840
[SPEAKER_14]: Tuesday's episode of Pointless on BBC One.

111
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:38,720
[SPEAKER_14]: The contestants were presented with some pictures of celebrities born in the year 2000, along with their initials.

112
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,960
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, it's not that this contestant gets this wrong.

113
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,480
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just that he gets it wrong in such a completely pro-evo way.

114
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,620
[SPEAKER_14]: It could be a snag.

115
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,120
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know who anybody is there, do you?

116
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:47,360
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

117
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,820
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't got a clue.

118
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,620
[SPEAKER_09]: I know C's a footballer and I don't do football, so I think it's Elland Harkson.

119
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:55,840
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to go for it.

120
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,880
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, you can say Elland Harkson.

121
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,480
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have Elland Harkson.

122
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,700
[SPEAKER_14]: Julia and Mike went for Elland Harkson.

123
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,940
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see if that is right for C.

124
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:08,700
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

125
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,840
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm afraid.

126
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:10,920
[SPEAKER_14]: No, you've got the right initials.

127
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,160
[SPEAKER_14]: That's great.

128
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:23,040
[SPEAKER_14]: Always one of the lower key joys of Pointless, Nick, is when Alexander Armstrong has to read back a quite obviously wrong answer back to the contestant even he knows is wrong.

129
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,380
[SPEAKER_14]: And he said it in quite a keasy way, which I quite liked as well.

130
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,000
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, there's a sort of very faint whiff of passive aggression about it.

131
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,340
[SPEAKER_12]: You've gone with Elland Harkson.

132
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,360
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you sure about that?

133
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,000
[SPEAKER_12]: Interesting answer.

134
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,560
[SPEAKER_12]: Interesting answer.

135
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,320
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's see if that's correct.

136
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:41,120
[SPEAKER_14]: The poise of Elland Harkson, Charlie, is, as Paul points out, is very pro-evo.

137
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,500
[SPEAKER_14]: It is just about the right amount of corruption of the name.

138
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:54,820
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I really enjoy when I see, in the way that people have the footballers' names and things, I'll quite often do pro-evo player names and things when I'll see a name that looks exactly like an Elland Harkson.

139
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,900
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like a bastardisation of a person's name.

140
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,760
[SPEAKER_13]: Be that a footballer, be that a friend of mine.

141
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,300
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.

142
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,360
[SPEAKER_13]: I really like it.

143
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,280
[SPEAKER_12]: Elland Harkson, that's a golfer's name, isn't it?

144
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,000
[SPEAKER_12]: Elland Harkson III or something.

145
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,300
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, okay.

146
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,600
[SPEAKER_14]: So you're going for the American.

147
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,880
[SPEAKER_14]: So he's on the American side of the Ryder Cup scenario.

148
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,200
[SPEAKER_14]: I think so, yeah.

149
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:12,860
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

150
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,720
[SPEAKER_14]: So Scandinavian heritage, but actually American.

151
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,420
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

152
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,140
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

153
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:17,460
[SPEAKER_14]: Fair enough.

154
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:21,380
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, this is the first time I'd ever seen a footballer confront this concept.

155
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,280
[SPEAKER_14]: Never seen a footballer talk about it, really.

156
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:31,340
[SPEAKER_14]: Wilfred Zaha, who is on loan at MLS side Charlotte FC from Galatasaray, which is an absurd state to be in anyway.

157
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,580
[SPEAKER_14]: I put up an Instagram story the other day, Nick, saying, I've got to make this clear.

158
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,520
[SPEAKER_14]: Just because you haven't been fortunate to play for top clubs doesn't mean you're not a top player.

159
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,600
[SPEAKER_14]: So please, I'm just a baller and always will be.

160
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,920
[SPEAKER_14]: So don't put me in streets will never forget.

161
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,480
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a player rejecting that he's a streets never forget player.

162
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,620
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, I've got, I've got, I don't want to tackle whether Zaha is streets will never forget.

163
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,340
[SPEAKER_14]: He isn't.

164
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,060
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's great to see footballers taking this head on.

165
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:55,440
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

166
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:02,720
[SPEAKER_12]: And you can, you can kind of see, you can definitely see why, because it is a sort of, yeah, you were, you, you were good, but ultimately you did nothing, didn't you?

167
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:08,640
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm glad that they're engaging with this or this one specific player is engaging with it.

168
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,180
[SPEAKER_12]: And in such a kind of, I don't know, I can't quite figure out the method he's gone, gone with to do this.

169
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:21,800
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't figure out if it's like a sort of LinkedIn post kind of pasted onto an Instagram story kind of thing.

170
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,420
[SPEAKER_12]: The format is just incomprehensible.

171
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,440
[SPEAKER_13]: It is weird.

172
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:36,740
[SPEAKER_13]: And it does beg the question, like what is, who's right at the cutoff point, you know, and I, and I think it's fair enough because there is something a bit, there's something very condescending about streets will never forget.

173
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,220
[SPEAKER_13]: Definitely.

174
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:44,760
[SPEAKER_14]: On that note then, Charlie, I'd never conceived the idea before that players might be out there quite anxious about them being on the threshold of it.

175
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,180
[SPEAKER_14]: I've gone to Charlotte.

176
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,740
[SPEAKER_13]: Are people going to think, oh, no, this feels like quiet streets will never forget.

177
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,900
[SPEAKER_13]: And forget sort of move.

178
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:58,240
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, I mean, like would Yannick Bellassi, would he be, you know, Zaha's former teammate at Palace?

179
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,420
[SPEAKER_13]: Would he be streets will never forget?

180
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:00,800
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

181
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,400
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow.

182
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,580
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it might even be on his second Brazilian club.

183
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,180
[SPEAKER_14]: That's great.

184
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,160
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, that, that is streets will never forget.

185
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,860
[SPEAKER_14]: I think he's on, I think he is on that.

186
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,040
[SPEAKER_14]: He passes that threshold.

187
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,080
[SPEAKER_14]: I think so.

188
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,340
[SPEAKER_14]: Zaha's certainly not.

189
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,200
[SPEAKER_14]: He's, he's, he's Premier League elite.

190
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,100
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no problem there.

191
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:15,540
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

192
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,920
[SPEAKER_14]: Over the last sort of couple of seasons or so, Nick, I think there's been a huge focus on the concept of goal involvements.

193
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,360
[SPEAKER_14]: And we haven't found a more elegant way of describing it.

194
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:29,520
[SPEAKER_14]: Mohamed Salah this season obviously become, you know, incredible case study for goal involvements.

195
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:33,940
[SPEAKER_14]: His assists are taking almost as much of the limelight as his goals.

196
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,820
[SPEAKER_14]: But Eldon Hasic writes in, says, what's the record most goals scored in a season without an assist?

197
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:44,180
[SPEAKER_14]: Patrick Schick is taking the centre forward's sole job being to score goals, literally.

198
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,300
[SPEAKER_14]: He's scored 25 goals this season without a single assist.

199
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,320
[SPEAKER_14]: He doesn't give a shit about goal involvement.

200
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,300
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

201
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,860
[SPEAKER_12]: I really like this kind of thing.

202
00:10:53,020 --> 00:11:03,140
[SPEAKER_12]: It also, it just reminds me of, I don't know, did you ever, like either a Sunday league or a school or something, ever play with someone who was like, look, I'm a striker.

203
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,420
[SPEAKER_12]: My job is a striker.

204
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,360
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not doing anything else.

205
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:14,480
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember one lad I played with refused to, like, make a run outside of what he defined his designated striker zone.

206
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,480
[SPEAKER_12]: So he's like, look, you know.

207
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,480
[SPEAKER_13]: Is he between the best work between the width of the post?

208
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,160
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, exactly.

209
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:20,740
[SPEAKER_12]: It was that.

210
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,040
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

211
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,240
[SPEAKER_12]: It was like, look, you're playing on the left.

212
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,140
[SPEAKER_12]: That's your ball.

213
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,640
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's like, Jesus Christ, mate.

214
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,820
[SPEAKER_12]: But this is the kind of the ultimate extension of that, I suppose.

215
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:33,180
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, Cristiano Ronaldo had some seasons at United, towards the end at United.

216
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:38,440
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, you know that in 07-08 where it went crazy, he suddenly saw 31 goals.

217
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:42,780
[SPEAKER_13]: I think he got like six or seven assists, which isn't bad, but it was sort of downweighed a bit.

218
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:43,540
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

219
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,980
[SPEAKER_13]: You're kind of like at that point, you know, there was a small part of your goal involved.

220
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:51,420
[SPEAKER_13]: And when he came back, he got 18 goals and three assists in this one sort of main season.

221
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:58,200
[SPEAKER_14]: I instinctively thought of this, Nick, I was going to describe it as kind of a throwback, Patrick Schick, just you're doing his job and not caring about assists.

222
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,180
[SPEAKER_14]: But is that a particularly old-fashioned thing, like strikers not turning provider?

223
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,560
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel like that's always been part of their job.

224
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:09,980
[SPEAKER_14]: It isn't a newfangled thing for them having to drop deep and get involved or even just, you know, flick on a cross.

225
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:10,560
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

226
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:16,160
[SPEAKER_12]: You get the old-fashioned centre forward who, you know, holds the ball up and all that kind of thing.

227
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:16,500
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

228
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,960
[SPEAKER_12]: So, yeah, it's not particularly newfangled or maybe John Aldridge would go absolutely mental at this work idea.

229
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,020
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think the doing it is newfangled, the caring about it and the sort of listing of it is, yeah.

230
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:28,480
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

231
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,040
[SPEAKER_14]: That being that part of their remit, like, you know, pointedly.

232
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,520
[SPEAKER_14]: Did Gerd Muller get any assists?

233
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,920
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, you know, where does the poacher-assister line get drawn?

234
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,300
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, certainly not.

235
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,920
[SPEAKER_12]: Filipo Inzaghi, not a big assistman.

236
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:40,460
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

237
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,040
[SPEAKER_13]: I wonder if it would have changed, though, how some players would view it.

238
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,960
[SPEAKER_13]: Someone like Alan Smith, who didn't, he wasn't prolific, was he?

239
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:49,720
[SPEAKER_13]: But he probably did get a fair few assists because he was quite like a nod-down man.

240
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,840
[SPEAKER_13]: Which might have then changed it because his goal involvements then would have been half-decent.

241
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:59,960
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was, you know, of course, we're overlooking the fact that they used to be, you know, it used to be the de facto situation.

242
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,040
[SPEAKER_14]: So they would have picked up assists all over the place.

243
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,740
[SPEAKER_14]: Sutton and Shearer all over again.

244
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:10,700
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, Nick, he's the only player in the top 30 league goal scorers in Europe's big five leagues not to have an assist.

245
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,320
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's actually, that makes him something of an anomaly.

246
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,080
[SPEAKER_14]: Quite like it.

247
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,820
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just a...

248
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,120
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you think it was to keep the run going?

249
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,680
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought I was not doing it.

250
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,560
[SPEAKER_12]: I've gone this far.

251
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:22,760
[SPEAKER_12]: How'd you do that?

252
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,560
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you just wouldn't pass?

253
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,080
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't do it!

254
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:25,500
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't shoot!

255
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,580
[SPEAKER_12]: Deliberately pass to your colleagues on their wrong foot, maybe?

256
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:28,960
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

257
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,400
[SPEAKER_12]: I've dug deep into this, Charlie.

258
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:36,740
[SPEAKER_14]: Controversially, Transfermarkt had him down as producing an assist in Leverkusen's 2-2 draw against Werder Bremen in October.

259
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,940
[SPEAKER_14]: But his cross was shinned into his own net by Felix Agu.

260
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,720
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm not having that as an assist.

261
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,340
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't assist an own goal, can you?

262
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,740
[SPEAKER_13]: No, up to don't count.

263
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:45,600
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

264
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,600
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't get assists for own goals.

265
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,100
[SPEAKER_13]: That's good.

266
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,180
[SPEAKER_13]: Sometimes I think unfairly, but yeah, you don't.

267
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,860
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, like spiritually, you've done the hard work.

268
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,260
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, you haven't created an own goal, have you?

269
00:13:55,340 --> 00:14:00,520
[SPEAKER_14]: He was also given an assist in the DFB Pokal semi-final against Fortuna Dusseldorf last season, Nick.

270
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:04,100
[SPEAKER_14]: But that was a scuffed shot that just fell to Jeremy Frimpong.

271
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,500
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm not having that as an assist either.

272
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,000
[SPEAKER_12]: This is getting into Anjposta-Kogu territory here, assists being the most pointless.

273
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,020
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, completely agree.

274
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:20,340
[SPEAKER_14]: He did, however, set up Victor Boniface against Dortmund in December 2023, Charlie, which is 473 days ago.

275
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,440
[SPEAKER_13]: His assist drought.

276
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,140
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

277
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,620
[SPEAKER_13]: I wonder if this is a thing.

278
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:31,460
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, presumably, if there is discourse, which there must be around him and the team, then surely people have strong opinions on it.

279
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,640
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, there should be a column in this.

280
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:39,880
[SPEAKER_14]: The only nearest challenger that Eldin Hasic could find for this, Nick, was Benny McCarthy for Blackburn back in 2006-07.

281
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,820
[SPEAKER_14]: 18 goals, no assists.

282
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:46,900
[SPEAKER_14]: And he strikes me as the sort of player who kind of would be that sort of mould.

283
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:53,400
[SPEAKER_14]: Between the sticks, a finisher, not necessarily known for his sort of channel running necessarily, was he?

284
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:53,660
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

285
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:59,760
[SPEAKER_12]: And also, I can't remember how Blackburn did in that season, but not a team with a lot of other goal scorers in it, maybe.

286
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:05,580
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, I would love to know if anyone's going to beat Patrick Schick, who's on 25 goals, zero assists.

287
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:11,480
[SPEAKER_14]: Speaking of continental strikers, the news emerged this week that Kevin Gamero has retired.

288
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:20,260
[SPEAKER_14]: And what better tribute to Kevin Gamero could there be than us throwing back to classic episode pure Europa League 11?

289
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:28,620
[SPEAKER_14]: So up front, this is the fun bit and perhaps the most clear-cut part of our team of all.

290
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,280
[SPEAKER_14]: First up, James, Kevin Gamero.

291
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:31,800
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

292
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:37,260
[SPEAKER_14]: Neil Bates writes in, says, part of that Sevilla team who won it 17 times in a row, then went on to win it with Atletico.

293
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:44,000
[SPEAKER_14]: I also remember him doing well against English teams and therefore becoming a perennial target for your West Hams, your Newcastles and your Everton's.

294
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,940
[SPEAKER_11]: And I have to say, it is astonishing that he didn't play for Everton.

295
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,860
[SPEAKER_11]: All of that really does put him in the sweet spot, doesn't it?

296
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,980
[SPEAKER_11]: And I can't, I mean, he must have played in the Champions League, but I just can't picture it.

297
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,860
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you know what Kevin Gamero looks like?

298
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,580
[SPEAKER_11]: Only because I looked at his Wikipedia page.

299
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,720
[SPEAKER_11]: I refused to do it just so I could keep that going.

300
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,480
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to ever know what Kevin Gamero looks like.

301
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,440
[SPEAKER_11]: How many caps has he got?

302
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,180
[SPEAKER_11]: He's French, right?

303
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,660
[SPEAKER_11]: How many caps has he got?

304
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:14,000
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I just know nothing about him beyond the context of him occasionally turning up like, you know, when I'm checking your own police scores on a Thursday night.

305
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,560
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just where he exists in my mind.

306
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,640
[SPEAKER_11]: 13 France caps, I'm told.

307
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,300
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's not terrible.

308
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,200
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not short of decent strikers France, are they?

309
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:27,760
[SPEAKER_11]: But, you know, clearly not good enough to earn a regular place or get any minutes at any tournament.

310
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:28,920
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, done and dusted.

311
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,960
[SPEAKER_11]: Kevin Gamero, sorted.

312
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,420
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, over to the England scene now, Nick.

313
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:38,260
[SPEAKER_14]: Dan Byrne, fairly inevitably, is on record as saying he thought his England call-up was a wind-up.

314
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,320
[SPEAKER_14]: His week just continues to give.

315
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,800
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm extending his week for as long as it needs to go.

316
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,800
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the perfect, like, category of player that, A, he's old.

317
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,240
[SPEAKER_12]: B, he hasn't, from a humble background, footballing background as well.

318
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:56,880
[SPEAKER_12]: But also, there hasn't been, I know it's been a lot of, you know, there's no left-backs in the available or whatever.

319
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:07,540
[SPEAKER_12]: But there hasn't been enough of like a, I don't know whether it's clamour territory, but there hasn't been enough, there hasn't been enough discussion about him in the England team for it to be kind of inevitable or expected.

320
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,940
[SPEAKER_12]: So it is, in the perfect thought, it was a wind-up territory, isn't it?

321
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:16,840
[SPEAKER_14]: I love that caveat there, Charlie, that Nick gave of, you know, a potential dearth of options at left-back.

322
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:20,060
[SPEAKER_14]: I love the idea that Dan Byrne might be weighing that up as he reads the text.

323
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,240
[SPEAKER_14]: Going, wow!

324
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,480
[SPEAKER_14]: We aren't producing the same numbers anymore!

325
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:28,700
[SPEAKER_13]: He's also, his whole vibe is kind of outsider, unconventional.

326
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,660
[SPEAKER_13]: So, yeah, this is perfectly on brand.

327
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:35,440
[SPEAKER_14]: He said, when I got the message from the England manager, I thought it was a wind-up.

328
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,040
[SPEAKER_14]: I had to go away and check it was legit.

329
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:45,740
[SPEAKER_14]: Dan Byrne, the 20th player to be called up since John Solarko in 1991 to claim he believed his called-up was a wind-up.

330
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,440
[SPEAKER_14]: Just great to see that tradition extending into a new manager's reign.

331
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,560
[SPEAKER_14]: There's going to be a manager one day who bans it, bans all talk of it, because he's like, where's the self-belief?

332
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:54,480
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be...

333
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:54,820
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, yeah.

334
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:55,940
[SPEAKER_14]: Sports psychologist.

335
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:59,020
[SPEAKER_13]: We talk to a sports psychologist about what it says about the players.

336
00:17:59,300 --> 00:17:59,580
[SPEAKER_12]: True!

337
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,380
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's a thing, definitely.

338
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:05,120
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm interested in, I don't know if he talks about this before, but I'm interested in the verification process.

339
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,720
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I was just going to say, I had to go away and check it.

340
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,040
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, what's...

341
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,060
[SPEAKER_12]: How's he doing that?

342
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:10,820
[SPEAKER_12]: Does he...

343
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,780
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's like...

344
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,900
[SPEAKER_12]: Does he go to...

345
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,800
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know, who else...

346
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,400
[SPEAKER_12]: His most trusted Newcastle teammate who definitely should be in the squad, yeah.

347
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,420
[SPEAKER_12]: Anthony Gordon?

348
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,220
[SPEAKER_12]: Is he like...

349
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:22,840
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, Anthony Gordon, does he ask Nick Pope, is this really the right number?

350
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:23,600
[SPEAKER_12]: Rubbing it in.

351
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,680
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I mean, that's the thing.

352
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:29,840
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, first of all, you do, don't you, when you get like a spam from Royal Mail or whoever it is, you know, you check the sender.

353
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,040
[SPEAKER_13]: Does the number look dodgy?

354
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:31,940
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I wonder if he...

355
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,640
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, did he have his number?

356
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,540
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, because that would be your first thing, wouldn't it?

357
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,120
[SPEAKER_13]: Then you would think it was a wind-up.

358
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,240
[SPEAKER_13]: Phones are clever these days.

359
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,860
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, it comes up as a suspected spam if you get a call from a proper spam.

360
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,740
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, an extra layer of security for England call-ups.

361
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,900
[SPEAKER_14]: Suspected England manager.

362
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,680
[SPEAKER_14]: Singing the national anthem down the line.

363
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,760
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, that can't be him.

364
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:58,220
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, but England are now preparing for their double header of World Cup qualifiers against Albania and Latvia at Wembley, Nick.

365
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,340
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's deal with England-Albania first.

366
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,920
[SPEAKER_14]: Specifically, England 3-Albania 0.

367
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,160
[SPEAKER_14]: How do we think it's going to go?

368
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,060
[SPEAKER_14]: I think Anthem Watch will be a thing for about 15 seconds.

369
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:13,780
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, even though we know where we stand with it, the camera will still be on Tukul, not singing it.

370
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:20,500
[SPEAKER_12]: Presumably Matterface, the commentator, will make some kind of wry reference about how he's dealing with the Anthem Gate.

371
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,080
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I'm still fully on board with his approach for it.

372
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:27,240
[SPEAKER_14]: Dan Byrne scoring on his England debut, Charlie, is too absurd.

373
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:27,860
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't have it.

374
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,300
[SPEAKER_14]: His fortnight can't get that good.

375
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,140
[SPEAKER_14]: What a fortnight, yeah.

376
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,100
[SPEAKER_14]: Can't have it.

377
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:31,960
[SPEAKER_13]: What a fortnight, he said.

378
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:41,800
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I think it will be, after initial excitement, it will then be quite a slow start and it will reach a point after 15, 20 minutes of like, hasn't really got going yet, has it?

379
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,820
[SPEAKER_13]: As they sort of reflect on the fact that nothing's happened.

380
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:53,760
[SPEAKER_14]: A Harry Kane penalty will be the first goal of the Thomas Tuchel reign, Nick, within the first half an hour or so, and Sam Matterface will say, lift off.

381
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,340
[SPEAKER_14]: If this doesn't happen, that's it.

382
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,640
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know anything about football anymore.

383
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,080
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it too low-key?

384
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,200
[SPEAKER_14]: No, of course it isn't.

385
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:04,200
[SPEAKER_14]: A little defensive mix-up between Levi Colwell and Jordan Pickford will call some brief alarm.

386
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,580
[SPEAKER_14]: The England correspondent is having something to latch onto as a question mark over Thomas Tuchel.

387
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:17,900
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think we're quite at the stage of the Jordan Pickford, Dean Henderson thing where the camera would cut Henderson on the bench.

388
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,220
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not quite penny for his thoughts territory yet, is it?

389
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:21,760
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no.

390
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:27,580
[SPEAKER_12]: But it might be if Henderson made a few ricks in the game, maybe, I don't know.

391
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,140
[SPEAKER_14]: He'll definitely mix up the goalkeepers over the course of the two games.

392
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:37,300
[SPEAKER_14]: They're qualified, so nobody's coming on at half-time, but I can see an unexpected start for Dean Henderson.

393
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:43,720
[SPEAKER_14]: At half-time against Albania, Charlie, if, as you say, things start slightly slowly, what will Lee Dixon want to see from England?

394
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,900
[SPEAKER_14]: God, I just wanted to move the ball a bit quicker.

395
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:48,940
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all you want.

396
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:49,940
[SPEAKER_14]: It sounds everything.

397
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:55,040
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, we have, like, yeah, we've been wanting England to move the ball quicker for basically my whole lifetime.

398
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:55,320
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

399
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,540
[SPEAKER_13]: Probably before then as well.

400
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,780
[SPEAKER_13]: Just keep doing it.

401
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,540
[SPEAKER_14]: Just move it a bit quicker.

402
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,420
[SPEAKER_14]: A few days later, Nick, will be England 4-0 Latvia at Wembley.

403
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:05,960
[SPEAKER_14]: Morgan Rodgers' first England goal, I think, is coming in these two games.

404
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,660
[SPEAKER_14]: Is he starting, or is this a kind of off-the-bench?

405
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,780
[SPEAKER_14]: I think he'll start against Latvia.

406
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:10,260
[SPEAKER_14]: He might start in the second game.

407
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,940
[SPEAKER_14]: Little cameo against the Albanians and then earns a start against Latvia.

408
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,480
[SPEAKER_14]: And that goal, Charlie, will earn him man of the match, alone.

409
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,220
[SPEAKER_13]: And a humble interview after.

410
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,740
[SPEAKER_13]: I can see all that.

411
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:22,540
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you're right.

412
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,440
[SPEAKER_13]: I think there'll be an injury scare, won't there?

413
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:25,700
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

414
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,540
[SPEAKER_14]: Who will hobble off causing alarm for their domestic manager?

415
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,020
[SPEAKER_14]: I had Declan Rice for this.

416
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,140
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought it might be Jude Bellingham in the first game.

417
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,380
[SPEAKER_12]: It's nothing serious.

418
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,940
[SPEAKER_12]: Jude Bellingham's perpetually almost injured, though.

419
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,460
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the thing.

420
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,360
[SPEAKER_12]: He'll go off after about an hour of the first game.

421
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:43,020
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll be nothing serious, but he'll go back to Madrid and miss the second game anyway.

422
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:43,520
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

423
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,220
[SPEAKER_12]: So, yeah, two wins out of two, Charlie.

424
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,420
[SPEAKER_12]: But, of course, stir the test away.

425
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,240
[SPEAKER_12]: What's the threshold for job done?

426
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,000
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, 2-0 win or something like that.

427
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:54,760
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, a couple of clean sheets.

428
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,700
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, not the prettiest, but job done.

429
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:59,440
[SPEAKER_13]: Or even a so-far-so-good, you know, after a couple of comfortable wins.

430
00:21:59,620 --> 00:21:59,900
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

431
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,500
[SPEAKER_13]: Early days, but.

432
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:06,400
[SPEAKER_14]: Ross FJ writes in, and he told me a few days ago, no mention on football cliches for a year.

433
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,300
[SPEAKER_14]: So, that's two in two for you now, Ross FJ.

434
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:13,080
[SPEAKER_14]: He says, how long does an international manager have in regards to a honeymoon period?

435
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,800
[SPEAKER_14]: And can you have an international manager bounce?

436
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,200
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think it exists in international football, is it, Charlie, the bounce?

437
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,080
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you can have it.

438
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:21,520
[SPEAKER_13]: Really?

439
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:22,500
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

440
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:23,860
[SPEAKER_13]: Why do you think not?

441
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,140
[SPEAKER_13]: Just because there aren't so many games in a short space of time.

442
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,280
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I think the whole thing is just so drawn out.

443
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:32,500
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, new managers can come in and have an impact straight away, but there's too much build-up.

444
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,920
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't come straight in and have a game, is what I'm saying.

445
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:39,380
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't really, it doesn't really have that tangible kind of, it's really raised the players in the last couple of days.

446
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,360
[SPEAKER_13]: There's that, yeah.

447
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:52,180
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, but some do, I mean, weren't, it can occasionally happen, teams change a manager mid-tournament, which obviously, you know, didn't, was it the Ivory Coast won the most recent AFCON with a mid-management change?

448
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:52,880
[SPEAKER_13]: That's true.

449
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,080
[SPEAKER_12]: MS Faye.

450
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,540
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, talk about a new manager bounce.

451
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,240
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I can't argue with that.

452
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,300
[SPEAKER_14]: That's absolutely sure.

453
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:08,060
[SPEAKER_14]: As for the honeymoon period, Nick, I mean, England, apart from, say, Serbia away, I don't think England have a on-paper tough test in this calendar year.

454
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:13,200
[SPEAKER_14]: So we could be looking at a good full year of honeymoon period for Thomas Tuchel, if we play our cards right.

455
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,620
[SPEAKER_12]: He was already getting elters before he started the job.

456
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,060
[SPEAKER_12]: Is he even going to get any honeymoon period?

457
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:26,040
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, other matters could eat into his honeymoon period, of course, or is it just on-pitch matters, Charlie, that dictates your honeymoon period?

458
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,880
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it's a big defeat that ends it, right?

459
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:28,380
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

460
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,880
[SPEAKER_14]: Uninspiring performances, just generally?

461
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:31,900
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, maybe.

462
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:32,860
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't see it, though.

463
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,320
[SPEAKER_14]: I think England will be, well, qualifying, England will win 10 out of 10, or whatever it is, he'll be fine.

464
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:40,120
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I think it's too inconsequential for that to really end.

465
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:40,500
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

466
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,040
[SPEAKER_14]: Final note on the international break.

467
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:47,280
[SPEAKER_14]: Sky Sports News said that Christian Eriksson, Nick, expects to leave Manchester United at the end of the season.

468
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:51,700
[SPEAKER_14]: The Danish midfielder revealed nothing has been decided yet, but his contract expires in the summer.

469
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:55,780
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, he told this to Scandinavian, presumably TV station, TV2.

470
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,620
[SPEAKER_14]: And am I imagining this?

471
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:02,680
[SPEAKER_14]: Are all these particular types of semi-announcements always made when players are away on international duty?

472
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,180
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it just like they're away and think, well, if I say this, nobody will know back home.

473
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:06,860
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just going to say it.

474
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:07,860
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.

475
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:14,460
[SPEAKER_12]: I think there is a genuine thing that people, players think, I'm talking in Danish here.

476
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:20,720
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's no way this is going to get translated and be disseminated back to the country I play in.

477
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,040
[SPEAKER_12]: I really want this to be true.

478
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,240
[SPEAKER_12]: I really want it to be true.

479
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,120
[SPEAKER_13]: I think as well, they are just a lot more relaxed and comfortable with people they know a bit better.

480
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,500
[SPEAKER_13]: So they are more at ease.

481
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,100
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's probably an extent to which they are a bit like, more trust.

482
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:35,860
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't be bothered to be like, to just give them platitudes.

483
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,000
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, I can actually speak a bit more freely.

484
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:38,700
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

485
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,860
[SPEAKER_14]: It's got sort of bitching when you're away from, I don't know, from your family or work.

486
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,980
[SPEAKER_14]: You can speak more freely.

487
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,520
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

488
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:45,760
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah.

489
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:46,080
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

490
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,980
[SPEAKER_14]: That could well be it.

491
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:47,840
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

492
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,980
[SPEAKER_14]: That brings us to the end of part one.

493
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,440
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll be back very shortly.

494
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,280
[SPEAKER_03]: If fashion is your thing, eBay is it.

495
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:07,440
[SPEAKER_03]: eBay is where I find all my favorites, from handbags to iconic streetwear, all authenticated.

496
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,320
[SPEAKER_03]: For real.

497
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,040
[SPEAKER_03]: This time, a little Supreme, some Gucci.

498
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,840
[SPEAKER_03]: I even have that vintage Prada on my watch list.

499
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,180
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why eBay is my go-to for all my go-tos.

500
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:18,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, eBay.

501
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,980
[SPEAKER_03]: The place for new, pre-loved, vintage, and rare fashion.

502
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:22,840
[SPEAKER_03]: eBay.

503
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Things people love.

504
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,740

00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,400
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, this episode is brought to you in association with NordVPN.

526
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:04,200
[SPEAKER_14]: For those who don't know, VPN stands for Virtual Private Network.

527
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:10,180
[SPEAKER_14]: It secures your connection, protecting your personal information and online activity, especially on public Wi-Fi.

528
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:17,260
[SPEAKER_14]: A VPN can also make your phone or laptop appear as if it's in another country, which is great for accessing content while traveling.

529
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:21,320
[SPEAKER_14]: I just realized I said a little laptop, like laxative, Charlie, like Andy Campbell.

530
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,420
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, Samuel Peterson got in touch.

531
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:31,720
[SPEAKER_14]: Here is Graeme Lasseau on co-coms for NBC in the 94th minute of Arsenal 1 Chelsea nil the other day.

532
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:40,340
[SPEAKER_14]: Gabrielle nods a harmless kin and Dewsbury Hall cross back to David Ryer, milks the applause of the Emirates and Graeme Lasseau has had enough.

533
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,940
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's Dewsbury Hall.

534
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,380
[SPEAKER_14]: There's been lately in drama here.

535
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:59,140
[SPEAKER_12]: Are we moving into a period of football where every time a player does anything, they expect to get a standing ovation from the crowd?

536
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,180
[SPEAKER_12]: The sincere that you hope not.

537
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,820
[SPEAKER_14]: Joe Spate there, I think, is on comms diplomatically batting this away, Charlie.

538
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,620
[SPEAKER_13]: I was waiting for a co-commentator to crack about this.

539
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:14,400
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, because it's not very becoming for a defender as well, that they should just get on with it.

540
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,140
[SPEAKER_13]: It's becoming a little bit tenuous.

541
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,540
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of these situations, though.

542
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:23,760
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, I feel like the bar for G-ing up the crowd has been lowered in the last few weeks alone.

543
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,540
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, certainly that is true.

544
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,300
[SPEAKER_13]: And a friend of mine was messaging me about this.

545
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,760
[SPEAKER_13]: Kind of, yeah, what's the threshold?

546
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,980
[SPEAKER_13]: When can you be G-ing them up?

547
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,120
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, does it depend on your status within the team?

548
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:37,060
[SPEAKER_13]: Does it matter the match state, the opponent, all of that?

549
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,140
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, there are some rules.

550
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:41,500
[SPEAKER_13]: There are some times you see it, and you're a bit like, eh, do you have the right to do that?

551
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:46,740
[SPEAKER_14]: Someone asked Nick if we should do a G-ing up the crowd 11, like a generic one.

552
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:47,640
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm all for that.

553
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:52,920
[SPEAKER_14]: But the thing is, Graeme Lesseau would be in the very top percentiles for this if he was playing now.

554
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:57,440
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm really convinced that he would be a prolific G-ing up of the crowd.

555
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:05,340
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and also he would be in the very specific scenario, the looking very pleased with himself after a neat header back to the goalkeeper kind of thing.

556
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,080
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, absolutely.

557
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:06,660
[SPEAKER_12]: So, yeah.

558
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:15,300
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, if you want to try NordVPN for yourself, go to nordvpn.com slash cliches, and our link will also give you four extra months on the two-year plan.

[SPEAKER_14]: There's no risk with Nord's 30-day money-back guarantee, and the link is also in the podcast description if you need it.

561
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,520
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, next up, this came from Daniel Lewis.

562
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:35,060
[SPEAKER_14]: This is Ailey Barber on BBC Final Score duty last weekend for Manchester City versus Brighton, as Carlos Beliba puts a golden chance over the bar to win it for the visitors.

563
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:42,160
[SPEAKER_14]: Unbelievable chance, and Carlos Beliba saw his name in absolute lights, but he blasted it.

564
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,320
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a great absoluting, Nick.

565
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,600
[SPEAKER_14]: I really, really like it.

566
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,460
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely sensational.

567
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,280
[SPEAKER_12]: A superb addition to it.

568
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,480
[SPEAKER_12]: I absolutely love that.

569
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,980
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't make sense, but it doesn't matter.

570
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,140
[SPEAKER_12]: It really enhances it, Charlie, as well.

571
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,960
[SPEAKER_13]: In absolute lights, yeah, that's great.

572
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:00,480
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, given the magnitude of the miss as well, it was more than presentable as well.

573
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,040
[SPEAKER_14]: I think absolute lights really sums it up.

574
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,180
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, all for absoluting.

575
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:09,920
[SPEAKER_14]: We're yet to see a completely unacceptable absoluting on the podcast, and long may that continue.

576
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:18,000
[SPEAKER_14]: Billy Backhouse writes in next, Nick, and says, My Club Reading sit eighth in League One, two points adrift of the playoffs.

577
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:24,160
[SPEAKER_14]: Recent BBC match reports describe us variously as playoff chasers, hopefuls, and contenders.

578
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:29,320
[SPEAKER_14]: Are these synonyms, or are they different points along a scale of how realistic our playoff ambitions are?

579
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:35,260
[SPEAKER_14]: So, for extra context, yeah, they are two points off Huddersfield, who are sixth.

580
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,660
[SPEAKER_14]: So, they're in the mix.

581
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:40,180
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think chasing is fine.

582
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:41,440
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefuls?

583
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,620
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you could be lower and be hopefuls, couldn't you?

584
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,860
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think they're in the perfect, the sweet spot for chasers.

585
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,460
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefuls, you're right.

586
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:54,220
[SPEAKER_12]: I would, so, Leighton Orient are three points beneath them.

587
00:30:54,280 --> 00:31:00,040
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that might be the kind of threshold for hopefuls.

588
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,900
[SPEAKER_12]: They're not contenders, I don't think.

589
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:05,480
[SPEAKER_12]: I think you do need to be in the playoff places to be contenders.

590
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:09,360
[SPEAKER_14]: I would allow a little bit of a looser interpretation than that.

591
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:13,520
[SPEAKER_14]: But hopefuls, certainly, Charlie, has to be more than just mathematics, right?

592
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,500
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I think so.

593
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:18,340
[SPEAKER_13]: But I also think chasers does imply a degree of momentum.

594
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:23,420
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I don't think you'd say it about a team who's in a really bad run of form and were seventh or eighth.

595
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,660
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, Leighton Orient have lost four of the last five.

596
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,120
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you couldn't really call them playoff chasing Leighton Orient, could you?

597
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,120
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.

598
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:34,860
[SPEAKER_13]: I think they do need a bit of upward momentum to hit the chasers.

599
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,460
[SPEAKER_14]: Only two wins in the last five for Reading themselves, Nick.

600
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:45,880
[SPEAKER_14]: So, whilst they're still chasing and presumably still hopeful, maybe their contenders label is up for serious contention.

601
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:46,620
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that works.

602
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,360
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it does.

603
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,820
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, Billy Backhouse, please be reassured.

604
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,940
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, next up, Gifu Damio gets in touch on Blue Sky, Charlie.

605
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:58,540
[SPEAKER_14]: And he was watching highlights of Leicester versus Manchester United on MUTV.

606
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:05,160
[SPEAKER_14]: And the commentator said the ball had been squirrelled clear just before Garnaturi doubled Manchester United's lead.

607
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:13,040
[SPEAKER_10]: Crossfield ball finds Diogo Deleu, brilliantly Deleu, attacking in the penalty area, gets a right-footed shot away, falls to Rasmus Hoyland, who can't bring it under control.

608
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:17,860
[SPEAKER_10]: Squirrelled clear by Leicester, picked up by Noos Masraoui.

609
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,380
[SPEAKER_14]: I've got a really vivid image of what squirrelling clear would mean.

610
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:27,480
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a little bit like when a full-back has to deal with a cross coming from the other side and they have to sort of smuggle it behind.

611
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,500
[SPEAKER_14]: I think squirrelling is a little bit like that.

612
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,860
[SPEAKER_14]: There's an inelegance to it, but also quite tricky.

613
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:36,920
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, like a little jab because they can't get a proper contact on it.

614
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:41,800
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think it goes particularly far in those sort of awkward situations.

615
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:46,620
[SPEAKER_14]: And crucially, Nick, as well, on top of that, it can't be aimed at anybody.

616
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,700
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, it's just getting the ball away, squirrelling.

617
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:54,120
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, even if we were to allow it into the lexicon, squirrelling has to be a fairly aimless pursuit, surely.

618
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,980
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and you can't actually kick the ball very far.

619
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:05,340
[SPEAKER_12]: You either have to, you can't like, no more than about five yards, I would have thought, you can't squirrel a ball a long way up the pitch.

620
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,240
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you just squirrel it?

621
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,380
[SPEAKER_14]: Squirrel it, anywhere will do.

622
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:14,440
[SPEAKER_14]: On that point, I don't think anywhere does do for squirrels, though, Charlie.

623
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,280
[SPEAKER_14]: They know exactly where they want to put things.

624
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,600
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, they're not just scattering stuff.

625
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,680
[SPEAKER_14]: They're putting it either in their, what's a squirrel's home called?

626
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:22,480
[SPEAKER_14]: Nest?

627
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:22,960
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

628
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:23,760
[SPEAKER_14]: They just want to have a nest.

629
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,460
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I don't know.

630
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:29,580
[SPEAKER_14]: But, yeah, I mean, for hibernation purposes, they know exactly where things have to go.

631
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,640
[SPEAKER_14]: So, they're less aimless than perhaps I'm giving them credit for.

632
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,900
[SPEAKER_14]: A dray, apparently.

633
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:34,820
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that right?

634
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:35,680
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, there you go.

635
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:35,980
[SPEAKER_12]: Cool.

636
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,600
[SPEAKER_14]: There's always something weird for them, isn't it?

637
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:47,820
[SPEAKER_12]: I know, I realise I'm stepping in and taking literally Dave to the extreme here, but the kind of peak of squirrelling will be a player who just pops the ball on his cheek and runs away with it.

638
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:51,360
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and then, yeah, the new curl-on, perhaps.

639
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,220
[SPEAKER_14]: Like that.

640
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,300
[SPEAKER_14]: The squirrel dribbler.

641
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:54,780
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

642
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:58,760
[SPEAKER_14]: Everyone has been lording this new Netflix drama with praise.

643
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,500
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't seen any bad words said about it.

644
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:04,820
[SPEAKER_14]: Adolescence on Netflix, which is causing something of a moral panic as well.

645
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:14,680
[SPEAKER_14]: And Owen Cooper, who plays the kid at the centre of this storm in the story, has been dubbed the Lionel Messi of acting, Charlie.

646
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,820
[SPEAKER_14]: And now, whenever you see a dubbing like this occur, you must always ask, who has dubbed him this?

647
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,920
[SPEAKER_14]: And has it just snowballed out of nowhere?

648
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:28,220
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it does feel like one that someone has just said in a throwaway podcast or something, and then that's what it's been latched onto.

649
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,280
[SPEAKER_14]: And do we know?

650
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,760
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, who has dubbed him this?

651
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:34,120
[SPEAKER_14]: The good news is, it's come from a solid source.

652
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:39,300
[SPEAKER_14]: It's from his co-star, Ashley Walters, who is speaking exclusively to the Metro.

653
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:43,060
[SPEAKER_14]: And at first, when I heard this quote, I thought it was just a throwaway line.

654
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:43,940
[SPEAKER_14]: But then...

655
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,460
[SPEAKER_10]: He's a generational talent, man.

656
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:51,460
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like the Lionel Messi of the acting game.

657
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:51,880
[SPEAKER_10]: It's true.

658
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:57,240
[SPEAKER_10]: You watch him and you're like, I don't get how you're doing this.

659
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,700
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, without hardly any life experience.

660
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:03,760
[SPEAKER_10]: And how are you finding these emotions in these pockets in these places?

661
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:06,160
[SPEAKER_10]: And he's doing it all naturally, you know.

662
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,560
[SPEAKER_10]: He's acting in the pockets.

663
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,160
[SPEAKER_14]: It's finding those little half spaces.

664
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,220
[SPEAKER_14]: Ah, I love that.

665
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:22,080
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's implying that not only is there kind of a precocious talent there, Charlie, but he's producing sort of nuanced little sort of elements in the pockets, which is what Messi would have been doing.

666
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,840
[SPEAKER_14]: So maybe it works better than it does on face value.

667
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:28,060
[SPEAKER_13]: This actor also doesn't really do anything for the first three minutes of a scene.

668
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,680
[SPEAKER_13]: He just sort of like wanders around, just sort of scoping.

669
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,580
[SPEAKER_13]: But then he just suddenly engages.

670
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,400
[SPEAKER_13]: It's incredible.

671
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,920
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, what's not tracking back in acting terms?

672
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:37,660
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, exactly.

673
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:50,780
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, fair play as well, because I would have thought his age might have meant that, you know, rather than Messi, whoever was describing it, might go for the kind of the youth element, you know, sort of prodigiously talented footballer, you know, the Wayne Rooney.

674
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,640
[SPEAKER_12]: Or Lamin-Yamal, the fact.

675
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,280
[SPEAKER_13]: Lamin-Yamal.

676
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,000
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I was thinking that.

677
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,820
[SPEAKER_13]: I just don't know if that would have the same kind of cut through.

678
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:06,300
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, if anything, you're probably going too niche with Lamin-Yamal, actually, Nick, because I get the distinct sense from Ashley Walters, he's not a football man, just from the pronunciation of Messi alone.

679
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,300
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's fine.

680
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,740
[SPEAKER_14]: If that's the name you're going for, that's absolutely fine.

681
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,700
[SPEAKER_14]: But now I'm definitely more inclined to watch it now.

682
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,420
[SPEAKER_14]: I seem to be the only person who hasn't done it yet.

683
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:26,360
[SPEAKER_14]: Meanwhile, speaking of Lionel Messi, Nick, after his latest effort for Inter Miami over the head of Brad Guzan of Atlanta in MLS the other night, of his 855 career goals, 48 of them have now been dinks.

684
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:29,320
[SPEAKER_14]: And he's holding steady at a rate of 5.6%.

685
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,520
[SPEAKER_14]: The dinksman continues.

686
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,420
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a lovely dink as well.

687
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,200
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, real textbook dink.

688
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,380
[SPEAKER_14]: Brad Guzan as well.

689
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,860
[SPEAKER_14]: The perennial Guzan.

690
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:41,680
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, someone tweeted the other day, does Brad Guzan just play for every MLS team or

691
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:48,620
[SPEAKER_14]: poor old Brad Guzan.

692
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:49,540
[SPEAKER_13]: He is 40 now.

693
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,180
[SPEAKER_13]: Fair play.

694
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:50,800
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

695
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:51,420
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

696
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,080
[SPEAKER_14]: That is a fair play.

697
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:58,500
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, just seems to be falling over after conceding a goal in every clip I watch.

698
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,120
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah.

699
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:03,600
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, Newcastle, the celebratory fallout from their Carabao Cup win just continues.

700
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,360
[SPEAKER_14]: Eddie Howe is going to be awarded the freedom of Newcastle.

701
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:12,740
[SPEAKER_14]: And Charlie, I already can picture just how earnestly he's going to accept this honour.

702
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:13,660
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my God.

703
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,060
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

704
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,940
[SPEAKER_14]: Now look, it's a tremendous honour.

705
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,060
[SPEAKER_14]: For this city.

706
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:18,620
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

707
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,380
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I'm not going to take it lightly.

708
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:23,840
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to really sort of perform my duties in a way.

709
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,580
[SPEAKER_14]: Not going to abuse it.

710
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:26,060
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

711
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,100
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not going to take the piss.

712
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,960
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, this city is really taking me into its heart.

713
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:37,240
[SPEAKER_14]: And yeah, the honorary freeman status is the highest honour the council can bestow on an eminent individual or group.

714
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:42,360
[SPEAKER_14]: The names of all honorary freemen are carved into the walls of the banqueting hall in the civic centre.

715
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:46,620
[SPEAKER_14]: But this just gets more and more Eddie Howe, the more I feel it.

716
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,020
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

717
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,300
[SPEAKER_14]: That brings us to the end of part two.

718
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,760

[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, look at that!

752
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,380
[SPEAKER_14]: Welcome back to Football Clichés.

753
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:41,680
[SPEAKER_14]: Our next correspondence comes from Two Guy Philiz, which is a fantastic name, Nick.

754
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,500
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure you agree.

755
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,560
[SPEAKER_14]: He says, I'm a Feyenoord supporter.

756
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:47,120
[SPEAKER_14]: We were watching the Feyenoord intergame at a friend's house.

757
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:54,580
[SPEAKER_14]: One of my friends was someone who recently got really into football, and he's only recently started a job archiving Dutch second-tier club's histories.

758
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,920
[SPEAKER_14]: What a job that is, by the way.

759
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,500
[SPEAKER_14]: And didn't follow anything about it beforehand.

760
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:06,960
[SPEAKER_14]: As many of these gatherings do, we just started talking a lot about football-related events of the past, like joking about Nigel de Jong's karate kick against Zabby Alonso in the World Cup final.

761
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:14,460
[SPEAKER_14]: It became increasingly clear that our friend had no idea what we were talking about, and he flat-out told us he didn't know anything about football pre-2021.

762
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:20,760
[SPEAKER_14]: Incredulously, the rest of us started asking about, in our mind, important and big football events and players of the past.

763
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,240
[SPEAKER_14]: He had no clue who Eden Hazard was, for example.

764
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:30,020
[SPEAKER_14]: They turned us into trying to educate him for about some of our favourite football moments of the past that were essential in our minds.

765
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,680
[SPEAKER_14]: For English football, think Liverpool in Istanbul 2005.

766
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,620
[SPEAKER_14]: Manchester City's first title, an Aguero moment.

767
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:40,660
[SPEAKER_14]: In the end, the best thing I could come up with was showing him Roberto Carlos's insane free kick for Brazil.

768
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:47,440
[SPEAKER_14]: What would you show a hypothetically football-mad adult who has no clue about anything in the past as essential historic viewing?

769
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,580
[SPEAKER_14]: What would you go for?

770
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,780
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's like a time-capsule dilemma, isn't it?

771
00:40:50,860 --> 00:41:03,840
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the Roberto Carlos thing is actually not bad, because you kind of, in that situation where you kind of, if you showed it like the Aguero goal, you'd need then to explain all the context as to why it was so important.

772
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:09,360
[SPEAKER_12]: And then, I mean, that's the evening gone before, while you kind of explain the thing around it.

773
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:14,720
[SPEAKER_12]: So like, I don't know, Brazilian Ronaldo before he did his knee in, maybe, a compilation of that.

774
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,720
[SPEAKER_12]: Or, you know, Messi doing something brilliant.

775
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:17,620
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

776
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,280
[SPEAKER_12]: You need something that looks brilliant.

777
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:24,380
[SPEAKER_12]: It is kind of notable, but you don't need to do a lot of work to explain why it's brilliant.

778
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,120
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, this is the crux of the matter, Charlie.

779
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:34,160
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you just go with pure footballing aesthetics and just show them this is how beautiful the game can be and not worry them about, you know, the permutations of what was going on?

780
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,600
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I just love this setup.

781
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:43,360
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, I have this fancy of, like, one of my sons at some point getting really into football and being like, Daddy, can you tell me everything that happened in football in the last 25 years?

782
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,320
[SPEAKER_13]: And he'd be like, well, son, sit down.

783
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,220
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, let me tell you a tale.

784
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,600
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, obviously, never going to happen.

785
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,940
[SPEAKER_13]: What a dad to have in this scenario, fella.

786
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:51,680
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, my God.

787
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:52,260
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, exactly.

788
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,060
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to be so wasted when they have no interest.

789
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,460
[SPEAKER_13]: But my brother was saying, Risi, actually, he's got a friend of his, their son's got really into football.

790
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:01,020
[SPEAKER_13]: And so he has been asking my brother about something.

791
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:05,740
[SPEAKER_13]: My brother's been, like, sending him regular kind of letters with, like, a different episode of football each time.

792
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:07,980
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it'd be such a fun thing to be able to do.

793
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:16,080
[SPEAKER_13]: In this instance, I mean, I'd be sort of overwhelmed as to, I mean, yeah, I would sort of say to him, like, where do you want to go?

794
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,300
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it, what are you after here?

795
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:19,340
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you want the kind of magic moments?

796
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,040
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you partisan in any way?

797
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:32,980
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you want to kind of, you know, because you could just show him, like, I don't know, all the World Cup final goals or something is just a little primer on, you know, just to quickly rattle you through and get you up to speed.

798
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:36,860
[SPEAKER_13]: These are some of the most significant big goals and moments of the last few decades.

799
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,480
[SPEAKER_13]: A goals video would be a great shout.

800
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:40,320
[SPEAKER_13]: Just show them a goals compilation.

801
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,220
[SPEAKER_14]: A goals, goals, goals.

802
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:46,780
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, but maybe that's too much of a blanket hit of just pure football action without any context.

803
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,980
[SPEAKER_14]: Not enough context, yeah.

804
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,000
[SPEAKER_14]: Pound for pound, Nick.

805
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:55,060
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I'd go for Michael Owen's goal to win it for England against Argentina in a friendly in Geneva in 2005.

806
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,140
[SPEAKER_14]: I love that game.

807
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,960
[SPEAKER_14]: Would you include Motti's commentary in it?

808
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,020
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely, yes.

809
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:04,140
[SPEAKER_13]: This is how football can be in a completely pointless city.

810
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:12,680
[SPEAKER_13]: I've said before, I think that game, we mentioned Pro Evo earlier, that game is the most, like, Pro Evo friendly game played in actual real life.

811
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:16,960
[SPEAKER_13]: Everything about it is so bizarre, like, because it's played at a weird neutral venue, isn't it?

812
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:17,540
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, yeah.

813
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:18,280
[SPEAKER_13]: Where is it?

814
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,260
[SPEAKER_13]: Switzerland or somewhere?

815
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:19,960
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, Geneva, yeah.

816
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:24,420
[SPEAKER_13]: It's in Geneva, like, you know, in the same way you're playing Pro Evo, you just pick a random stadium.

817
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:29,900
[SPEAKER_13]: The fact that, like in that game, all the big attacking players just seem to deliver and are really good.

818
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,800
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like weirdly competitive, despite being a friendly.

819
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:35,100
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just, it's such an odd game.

820
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:38,840
[SPEAKER_14]: It really overperforms its XG of how good a football game should be.

821
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,220
[SPEAKER_14]: There's no reason for that game to be good.

822
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:42,780
[SPEAKER_14]: And yet, somehow, it's the best football game ever played.

823
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:48,880
[SPEAKER_14]: On a similar note, Queen Elizabeth Barnard has written in, and this is a good one on the back of this.

824
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:55,300
[SPEAKER_14]: She says, my sweet boyfriend and I are currently watching Premier League years in a very bit part way, 20 minutes a night.

825
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,240
[SPEAKER_14]: He knows nothing about football.

826
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:59,740
[SPEAKER_14]: We're on episode 2011-12 season.

827
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,660
[SPEAKER_14]: He doesn't know what's special about it.

828
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:05,160
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm literally quivering with excitement for him to experience Aguero.

829
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,300
[SPEAKER_14]: What a way to do, someone to football.

830
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:10,380
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Premier League years, minute, sort of chunk by chunk.

831
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:11,540
[SPEAKER_13]: This is amazing.

832
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:17,580
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, this is like when I watched the Beckham documentary with my wife and it got to the Munich, it got to the Barcelona 99 bit.

833
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:19,560
[SPEAKER_13]: And she was kind of like, do they win this game?

834
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,840
[SPEAKER_13]: I was like, well, you know, wait and find out.

835
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:22,380
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, this is going to be good.

836
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,200
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, what's this bit?

837
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:23,640
[SPEAKER_14]: What's this bit?

838
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:24,520
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, exactly.

839
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,380
[SPEAKER_13]: I was kind of envious.

840
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:27,520
[SPEAKER_13]: But I do fear for Elizabeth Barnard here as well.

841
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:33,660
[SPEAKER_13]: Is this not a bit like when you introduce a friend or partner to a sitcom and yeah, everybody are like, oh, this bit's really funny.

842
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:34,700
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, you're going to love this.

843
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,260
[SPEAKER_13]: Kind of like, I'm not sure this is that good.

844
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,920
[SPEAKER_14]: She's like, yeah, he'll be like, no, I don't know.

845
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:43,400
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the whole sort of, you know, back rolling thing leaves me cold.

846
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,200
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, right.

847
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,120
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

848
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:50,280
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's delve into football creeping into people's wider lives now, Nick.

849
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:53,940
[SPEAKER_14]: Opening T says, does anyone ever do a big pants shop?

850
00:44:54,100 --> 00:45:03,600
[SPEAKER_14]: And then a few years later, when said pants are on their last legs, realise you've got to make some tough decisions about new replacements and feel a bit like Sir Alex Ferguson trying to create a new title winning team.

851
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,000
[SPEAKER_14]: But instead of football as being moved on, it's pants.

852
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:10,960
[SPEAKER_14]: And instead of a legendary football manager, I'm merely one of the leading pants wearers of his generation.

853
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:18,820
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's a real strategy to decide which pants, you know, have done everything they can for you.

854
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:20,080
[SPEAKER_13]: No, and clothes generally.

855
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:34,240
[SPEAKER_13]: I had this thought only the other day because, and again, this is in a similar, I'll think of it like squad building, but what often happens to me, you know, a t-shirt will get demoted from one I would wear in public to I'd wear this to sleep in or something.

856
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,340
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's the kind of phasing out period.

857
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,800
[SPEAKER_13]: You've had a frank discussion with the t-shirts and you're not going to get as many minutes this season.

858
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,480
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you want to leave, you know, it's still great to have you around.

859
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:45,580
[SPEAKER_13]: You'll be playing 20, 25 games, all competitions.

860
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,160
[SPEAKER_13]: You're just not going to be my first choice anymore.

861
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:49,520
[SPEAKER_13]: And then it's entirely up to them.

862
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,800
[SPEAKER_13]: But then there will come a point at which you have to fully let them go.

863
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,240
[SPEAKER_13]: And then they get demoted even from there to you're just out, I'm afraid.

864
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,840
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of the replies on Reddit to this post were gold, Nick.

865
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,360
[SPEAKER_14]: People just getting the scenario, let alone the podcast.

866
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,680
[SPEAKER_14]: Strange Branch said, you've got to know when to get rid and replace before they fall to a bit.

867
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,380
[SPEAKER_14]: Otherwise, there's a world of trouble.

868
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:09,280
[SPEAKER_14]: C.

869
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:12,060
[SPEAKER_14]: Bren 88 says, leave the pants before the pants leave you.

870
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:14,600
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

871
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:29,400
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know whether it's something particular to the type of pants that I favour, but the telltale sign that they're going downhill, the kind of waistband at the back, the bits of the elastic stop sort of poking through.

872
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:29,960
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

873
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:32,920
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's when you kind of...

874
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:33,560
[SPEAKER_12]: The legs have gone.

875
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:34,740
[SPEAKER_12]: The legs have gone.

876
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:35,380
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, exactly.

877
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:37,140
[SPEAKER_12]: Tremendous.

878
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:37,660
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

879
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:44,420
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's the first sign that I thought, well, I need to keep an eye on this pair because that's going to be causing problems further on down the line.

880
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:45,880
[SPEAKER_12]: There's some nuance to this, Charlie.

881
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:50,440
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a boon says, if you try and replace too many pairs of pants at once and the whole system falls apart.

882
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:51,960
[SPEAKER_14]: Mark M.

883
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:54,180
[SPEAKER_14]: Scientist says, you need to do it in smaller steps.

884
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,920
[SPEAKER_14]: Get old pairs out and replace so you're not doing a complete rebuild.

885
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:59,580
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's about evolution, isn't it?

886
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:03,720
[SPEAKER_14]: What an incredible phrase to use for your pants draw, complete rebuild.

887
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:08,960
[SPEAKER_14]: See, also, packing your suitcase for a weekend city break, I think is like picking an England squad for a major tournament.

888
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:11,100
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to reason with the things I leave out.

889
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:12,500
[SPEAKER_14]: Not this time.

890
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:13,160
[SPEAKER_14]: Look, listen.

891
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:14,120
[SPEAKER_14]: I need harmony.

892
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:14,500
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

893
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:16,280
[SPEAKER_13]: That's another bit of evolution.

894
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:21,480
[SPEAKER_13]: It's always tough when a previous favourite is now no longer getting the nod for those weekends away.

895
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:24,960
[SPEAKER_13]: But at the same time, you think to yourself, how I've moved on.

896
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,760
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, you know, the game moves on.

897
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,840
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, you used to be first name on the team.

898
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:28,200
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

899
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:30,040
[SPEAKER_12]: Frightening how quickly we move on.

900
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,020
[SPEAKER_12]: Strength in depth.

901
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:36,300
[SPEAKER_12]: Imagining a particularly flamboyant shirt that Adam Homes trashing a hotel room because he's not made the cut.

902
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:37,940
[SPEAKER_14]: A wild card option.

903
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:38,240
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

904
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,620
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, there's always room for that.

905
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:40,280
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

906
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:53,420
[SPEAKER_14]: Next up, Diplo Penguin gets in touch, Charlie, and says, listening to the BBC Radio 5 live coverage of the League Cup final build-up, Isaac Hayden described Eddie Howe as being one of those managers whose door is always open and you could go and knock on it whenever you had an issue.

907
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:56,380
[SPEAKER_14]: It got me thinking, what do managers actually do in their offices?

908
00:47:56,620 --> 00:48:00,100
[SPEAKER_14]: You typically picture a manager out on the training pitch doing the coaching part of the job.

909
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,320
[SPEAKER_14]: But what does the rest of the manager's day look like?

910
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:06,640
[SPEAKER_14]: What are they doing in there, sat by themselves ready for a player to just knock on the door and go in for a chat?

911
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:10,060
[SPEAKER_14]: Surely they aren't just dealing with emails and teams' messages like the rest of us.

912
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:12,500
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, let's deal with the first issue, though.

913
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:15,740
[SPEAKER_14]: If a manager's door's always open, do you need to knock on it?

914
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,140
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I think that's polite.

915
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:18,600
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a courtesy.

916
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:19,280
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

917
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:25,520
[SPEAKER_14]: But you can't be figuratively knocking on it, can you, like, waiting to get in the team if the manager's door's figuratively always open?

918
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:29,000
[SPEAKER_14]: Because they've already said you're allowed to go in and chat about it anyway.

919
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:31,080
[SPEAKER_13]: You said they can't be banging down their door as well.

920
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:31,800
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, you can't be, yeah.

921
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,940
[SPEAKER_13]: Some managers, you know, they do like to be visible.

922
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,300
[SPEAKER_13]: They'll get around and they'll chat.

923
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:45,500
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, like Pochettino, he'd be chatting to people and he'd be visible, whereas others do kind of hide themselves away and that can lead to issues sometimes.

924
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:57,640
[SPEAKER_14]: If fictional football has taught us anything, Nick, it says that manager's offices are purely for them to stand by the big windows overseeing the training pitch as the sun comes in and wondering what the hell they're going to do with the rest of the season.

925
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:01,760
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like a sort of looming godlike presence for the team.

926
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:09,180
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, the thing that old former Forest players always say about Brian Clough is you wouldn't, from, like, Saturday to Thursday, you wouldn't see him.

927
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:12,740
[SPEAKER_12]: And then he'd just kind of show up and the idea was that it would create a big impact.

928
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:15,760
[SPEAKER_12]: But I would just be thinking, what the fuck is he doing for the rest of the time?

929
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:19,680
[SPEAKER_12]: Is he kind of answering correspondence in his office or something?

930
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:20,160
[SPEAKER_12]: But, yeah.

931
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,500
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know how much admin they have to do, but yeah.

932
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,460
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, maybe they just need a place to go and decompress and I completely accept that.

933
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:39,800
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, this isn't footballers' names in things next, but the very important Twitter account, Coronation Street Fans UK, has said, Jack P. Shepard, open brackets, David Platt, reveals his Coronation Street contract is up this year.

934
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:42,440
[SPEAKER_14]: Could we be saying goodbye to a Weatherfield icon?

935
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:46,040
[SPEAKER_14]: Just another chapter, Charlie, in soap sounding like football.

936
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:50,620
[SPEAKER_14]: But if he is indeed off on a Bosman somewhere, it's got to be Hollyoaks, right?

937
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:52,280
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the only career path available.

938
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:54,840
[SPEAKER_14]: Going to be a villain in Hollyoaks.

939
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,160
[SPEAKER_13]: Contract is up is great.

940
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:57,300
[SPEAKER_13]: Not something you really think about.

941
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:05,740
[SPEAKER_13]: Is this sort of, with that revelation, is he, like with Christian Eriksson, is this a sort of, come and sign me up, please?

942
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:06,260
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

943
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,020
[SPEAKER_13]: Curious to know what Jack P. Shepard's game is.

944
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:08,600
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

945
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,080
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, traditionally, Nick, there are two options.

946
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:14,560
[SPEAKER_14]: There are the, there's the Turkish Super League option, which is Hollyoaks.

947
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:24,780
[SPEAKER_14]: Or there's the MLS option, which is going off and having a really short-lived detective series in ITV4, which is just named after the central character's surname, and that's it.

948
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:31,260
[SPEAKER_14]: And they have some inner turmoil or some sort of special skill that means that they can solve crimes quicker than everybody else.

949
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,900
[SPEAKER_14]: And they're at DI level, at least.

950
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:35,120
[SPEAKER_14]: They get to wear their own clothes.

951
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:38,560
[SPEAKER_12]: I think there's another option as well, which is a little bit more niche.

952
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:44,360
[SPEAKER_12]: But those kind of level of actors who then go to America and try and build a kind of career in Hollywood.

953
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:46,780
[SPEAKER_12]: And it never works.

954
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:51,380
[SPEAKER_12]: But occasionally, you'll be watching something and you'll see someone and go, hang on, is that?

955
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:51,900
[SPEAKER_12]: I know.

956
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:52,780
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it?

957
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:53,200
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it?

958
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:54,440
[SPEAKER_12]: How did they get in?

959
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:55,120
[SPEAKER_12]: Rewind that.

960
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:55,560
[SPEAKER_12]: Pause that.

961
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:56,060
[SPEAKER_12]: Rewind it.

962
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:57,940
[SPEAKER_12]: That's like Lloyd Kelly at Juventus.

963
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:02,100
[SPEAKER_14]: Definitely right.

964
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:02,800
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely right.

965
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:03,140
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

966
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:06,500
[SPEAKER_14]: The best combined stat I think I've ever heard now, Charlie.

967
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:07,480
[SPEAKER_14]: David O'Connell.

968
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:13,820
[SPEAKER_14]: Just visiting my mother's care home and I heard a member of staff say that the residents have a combined age of over 8,000 years.

969
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:15,200
[SPEAKER_14]: Fuck off.

970
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:16,260
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that impressive?

971
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,680
[SPEAKER_14]: What's the context?

972
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,120
[SPEAKER_13]: Why would you tell them that?

973
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:22,100
[SPEAKER_13]: But also, yeah, what point are you making?

974
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:23,680
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, obviously, they're old.

975
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,360
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, that's sort of baked in.

976
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:31,720
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, surely you need an element of kind of surprise or like that it's not the thing you'd expect necessarily.

977
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,400
[SPEAKER_14]: You want average age here, Nick.

978
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,880
[SPEAKER_14]: Surely, just to show how long, their longevity.

979
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:37,020
[SPEAKER_14]: They're keeping them alive.

980
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:38,980
[SPEAKER_14]: Not that they're stockpiling them.

981
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:41,620
[SPEAKER_14]: They're stockpiling the talent.

982
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:45,840
[SPEAKER_14]: This is sensational.

983
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:46,620
[SPEAKER_14]: 8,000 years.

984
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,140
[SPEAKER_14]: I just can't see the function of telling someone that at all.

985
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:52,980
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, dear.

986
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:58,100
[SPEAKER_14]: Similarly, let's return to our much-loved segment about talking about tenuous awards given to random things.

987
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:01,480
[SPEAKER_14]: Robert Dunn says, I spotted this while sorting my tea out tonight.

988
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:04,500
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't you hate it when the same team wins year in, year out?

989
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,620
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the co-op.

990
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:16,520
[SPEAKER_14]: The co-op of one Convenience Pizza Retailer of the Year in 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024.

991
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,200
[SPEAKER_14]: This is like Bayern Munich.

992
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:19,080
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.

993
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:22,740
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolute stranglehold on the convenience pizza industry.

994
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:23,380
[SPEAKER_12]: Fair play.

995
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:27,440
[SPEAKER_12]: The results speak for themselves, but I don't want to quibble this, but co-op pizzas are shit.

996
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:28,220
[SPEAKER_12]: Are they?

997
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:28,960
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

998
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:34,700
[SPEAKER_12]: The co-ops, they only get a supermarket on our high street, so we're sort of forced into it every now and then.

999
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:36,520
[SPEAKER_12]: But, yeah, they are rubbish.

1000
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,100
[SPEAKER_12]: Why are they winning it?

1001
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:38,780
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1002
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:42,420
[SPEAKER_13]: I would have thought it might be something, like, maybe they're the only one entering it or something.

1003
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,420
[SPEAKER_13]: No one else cares.

1004
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:46,860
[SPEAKER_14]: I've just surprisingly strident opinion and expected to hear it.

1005
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:57,500
[SPEAKER_14]: You try telling this to the PAPA Industry Awards because PAPA is the Pizza, Pasta and Italian Food Association, and they can't look past the co-op, I'm afraid.

1006
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,580
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's up for grabs in 2025, at least.

1007
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,760
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, I want to end with this.

1008
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:07,100
[SPEAKER_14]: Not the first time we've had some ice hockey cultural crossover with football cliches.

1009
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:12,240
[SPEAKER_14]: Arjen Patalainen says, I'm the Sheffield Steelers commentator for my sins on our live webcasts.

1010
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:15,460
[SPEAKER_14]: Part of the broadcast is used as the intro to the YouTube highlights package.

1011
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:19,880
[SPEAKER_14]: It's 20 to 30 seconds to preview the game, give it context, and cover the team news.

1012
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:23,940
[SPEAKER_14]: Inspired by Football League's goals round-up voiceovers, I'll sometimes theme it.

1013
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:30,460
[SPEAKER_14]: For the game on Saturday against the, er, Guildford Flames, I dropped in some of the Football Clichés podcast's favourite lines.

1014
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:35,340
[SPEAKER_09]: It's retro weekend in Sheffield, and special guest Scott Allison is here.

1015
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,100
[SPEAKER_09]: What a player he was, by the way.

1016
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:47,540
[SPEAKER_09]: He knows a thing or two about winning trophies, and if the Steelers are going to pick up silverware come 1 April, they need to bet a last weekend's return of three points in this home doubleheader, and stay in and around the title fight.

1017
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:51,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Guildford may be in sixth place, but listen, fair play to today's opponents.

1018
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:54,080
[SPEAKER_09]: They've taken points off the Steelers twice in 2025.

1019
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:56,860
[SPEAKER_09]: Defence or forward for Kevin Tanzi?

1020
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:58,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Probably a little bit of both.

1021
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:00,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Rhys Kelly is the seventh D-man.

1022
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,600
[SPEAKER_09]: Finley Ulrich joins Cole Schudra on the fourth line.

1023
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:07,400
[SPEAKER_09]: Marco Di Filippo backs up Matt Greenfield, with Mark Simpson and Brian Diffley missing out.

1024
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:08,560
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.

1025
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:12,860
[SPEAKER_14]: Lovely professional cadence at the end of that, but a lovely sextet of references there, Charlie.

1026
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:13,840
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's great.

1027
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:14,100
[SPEAKER_13]: What was your favourite?

1028
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:15,220
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a real whistle-stop tour.

1029
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:16,220
[SPEAKER_13]: The listen, fair play.

1030
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:18,240
[SPEAKER_13]: Always good to get that in.

1031
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:20,820
[SPEAKER_12]: The bit of both got a wonderful build-up, though, Nick.

1032
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:26,820
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought the bit of both was just on the brink of sounding too contrived, but the rest of it was very artfully done.

1033
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:27,720
[SPEAKER_12]: It was all kind of...

1034
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,940
[SPEAKER_12]: There was nothing, like, crowbarred in there.

1035
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:34,280
[SPEAKER_12]: There's nothing that anyone who has no idea about this would go, why is he talking like that?

1036
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:34,920
[SPEAKER_12]: That's really weird.

1037
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,580
[SPEAKER_12]: It all kind of sort of...

1038
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:38,200
[SPEAKER_12]: It all makes a lot of sense.

1039
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:46,660
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just a real delicate balancing act between the glee of doing it, but managing to seamlessly fit them into the actual cadence of talking about an ice hockey match that's about to happen.

1040
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:47,740
[SPEAKER_14]: I am Patelainen.

1041
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:49,020
[SPEAKER_14]: Hats off to you.

1042
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,260
[SPEAKER_14]: A listen, fair play.

1043
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:51,520
[SPEAKER_14]: All day long.

1044
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,240
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks to everyone for listening.

1045
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,540
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks to you, Charlie Eccleshare.

1046
00:54:54,680 --> 00:54:54,980
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1047
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:56,120
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks to you, Nick Miller.

1048
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:56,540
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1049
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:58,100
[SPEAKER_14]: And we'll be back on Tuesday.

1050
00:54:58,540 --> 00:54:58,860

1052
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Attention repeats, snoozers.

1053
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Set your alarm for the oddly specific sleep problem sale.

1055

1056
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:32,060
[SPEAKER_08]: In a little mattress store or mattress warehouse?

1057
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:33,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Visit mattresswarehouse.com.

1058
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:40,860
[SPEAKER_07]: If you work in quality control at a candy factory, you know strict safety regulations come with the job.
