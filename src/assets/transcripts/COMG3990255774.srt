1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,080
[SPEAKER_04]: The 2025 NCAA March Madness Men's Tournament is back, and this time it is bringing all the feels.

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:13,500
[SPEAKER_04]: The biggest event in kind of sports tips off March 18th, and you don't want to miss a second of the heart-pumping action.

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:19,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Catch all of the clutch shots, big-time plays, upsets, Cinderella's, Blue Bloods, and more.

4
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:29,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Tune in to the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship March 18th through April 7th on TBS, CBS, TNT, True TV, and Stream on Max.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,820
[SPEAKER_03]: It's perfectly brown, it's melty, it's sweet.

6
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,920
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the s'more you just cooked over the fire at AutoCamp.

7
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:40,660
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, Hilton brings you new ways to stay, where you don't just get nightly s'mores.

8
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:49,900
[SPEAKER_03]: You also get clubhouse happy hours to gather under the stars, all while staying in custom-designed airstreams, cabins, and tents, and insanely cool outdoor destinations.

9
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:55,820
[SPEAKER_03]: If AutoCamp sounds like a dream, it sounds like it's time to redeem those Hilton honors points at Hilton.com.

10
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Hilton for the stay.

11
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:03,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Hear that?

12
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Spring is back.

13
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,090
[SPEAKER_04]: And so is Church's seafood.

14

[SPEAKER_04]: Offer valid at participating locations.

17
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:19,510
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, you can sit there and look and play with all your silly machines as much as you like.

18
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,810
[SPEAKER_12]: Is Gascoigne going to have a crack?

19
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:22,830
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, you know.

20
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,050
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I say!

21
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:25,790
[SPEAKER_10]: He

22
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,280
[SPEAKER_12]: does it tame, and tame, and tame again.

23
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,780
[SPEAKER_12]: Crank up the music!

24
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,680
[SPEAKER_12]: Charge a glass!

25
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,860
[SPEAKER_15]: This nation is going to dance all night!

26
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:04,200
[SPEAKER_15]: Please donate 5p to your local referee to solve the new scourge of English football.

27
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,400
[SPEAKER_15]: Just how springboard-y was Newcastle's Carabao Cup triumph?

28
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,060
[SPEAKER_15]: Gary Neville stealing Peter Drury's lines.

29
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,700
[SPEAKER_15]: Is Dan Byrne having football's ultimate what-a-week he's having?

30
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,660
[SPEAKER_15]: Sunday goals in the Bundesliga.

31
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,640
[SPEAKER_15]: Some beautiful commentary vibrato.

32
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,520
[SPEAKER_15]: Thomas Tuchel sincerely speaking very well to the England press pack.

33
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,400
[SPEAKER_15]: A huge moment for generic match balls in the film industry.

34
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,400
[SPEAKER_15]: And Richard Keyes versus Cheltenham.

35
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,800
[SPEAKER_15]: Brought to your ears by Goalhanger Podcasts.

36
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,060
[SPEAKER_15]: This is Football Clichés.

37
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,380
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello everyone, and welcome to Football Clichés.

38
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,500
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm Adam Hurry, this is the Adjudication Panel.

39
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,800
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm joined by Charlie Eccleshare and David Walker.

40
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,300
[SPEAKER_15]: How are you doing?

41
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:42,760
[SPEAKER_15]: Very well.

42
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,360
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I'm good.

43
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:50,200
[SPEAKER_15]: Right, before we get on to matters, someone has explained something that we were talking about last week.

44
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,640
[SPEAKER_15]: The mini-controversy over the wall at the free kick between Manchester United and Arsenal at Old Trafford.

45
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:03,260
[SPEAKER_15]: H2G2 researcher says, A very silly but mathematically sound way to tell if you are 10 yards from a football.

46
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:10,740
[SPEAKER_15]: If you're 10 yards away from a football and 5 foot 10 tall, the distance from the ball to your eyes is 9.31 metres.

47
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:16,300
[SPEAKER_15]: If you hold something at arm's length, it's normally about 75 centimetres away from you based on that height.

48
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:23,280
[SPEAKER_15]: If you multiply the diameter of a football, 22 centimetres, by 0.75 metres, you get around 18 millimetres.

49
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:29,520
[SPEAKER_15]: So a football at 10 yards away on the ground looks the same size as something 18 millimetres held at arm's length.

50
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,640
[SPEAKER_15]: So a 5p piece is 18 millimetres.

51
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:39,460
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you're a referee and you wanted to check, hold a 5p piece up at arm's length and if it doesn't cover the football, you're too close.

52
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,920
[SPEAKER_15]: If it only just covers the football, you're about right.

53
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,540
[SPEAKER_15]: If it's bigger than the football, you're too far away.

54
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,660
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope this helps all referees out there.

55
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,920
[SPEAKER_14]: Charlie, this is great.

56
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,380
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.

57
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:52,700
[SPEAKER_14]: Will we see a sudden rush of referees bringing coins onto the football?

58
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,060
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I guess they've got a coin, haven't they, for the flip?

59
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,500
[SPEAKER_14]: You can just keep it.

60
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,100
[SPEAKER_14]: A 5p, that feels inadequate for the flip though, doesn't it?

61
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,160
[SPEAKER_15]: It really does.

62
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:04,940
[SPEAKER_15]: But great to have a use for the 5p because, I mean, it's a good coin.

63
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:05,600
[SPEAKER_15]: A dying breed.

64
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,740
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, because they're new-ish.

65
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,020
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, they're usually pretty shiny when you get one.

66
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,060
[SPEAKER_15]: But when are you using a 5p?

67
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,100
[SPEAKER_15]: Now you can.

68
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,260
[SPEAKER_15]: Take up refereeing.

69
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:14,820
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

70
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:26,620
[SPEAKER_15]: Where better to start the adjudication panel than events at Wembley on Sunday afternoon, the Carabao Cup final, Newcastle ending a wait for the major trophy, the length of which the UK's media outlets simply couldn't reach a consensus on.

71
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,560
[SPEAKER_15]: I have no idea how long their drought was.

72
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:28,960
[SPEAKER_15]: Anybody?

73
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,540
[SPEAKER_14]: There are two, aren't there?

74
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,900
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, because there's any competition and then there's a domestic competition.

75
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:36,700
[SPEAKER_14]: Ah, right.

76
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,180
[SPEAKER_14]: And there's a kind of Wembley drought.

77
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,700
[SPEAKER_14]: So, yeah, there are a few ones.

78
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,160
[SPEAKER_14]: They won the Intercity Fairs Cup, didn't they?

79
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,900
[SPEAKER_15]: Which is like, you know, no one really knows what that is, I don't think, anymore.

80
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,400
[SPEAKER_15]: So I guess that was the confusion.

81
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,020
[SPEAKER_15]: Whatever the longest, I guess, for headline purposes.

82
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:58,940
[SPEAKER_15]: But Charlie, where does this Carabao Cup final triumph rank amongst the most springboardiest League Cup final victories of the modern era?

83
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,000
[SPEAKER_15]: It felt very springboardy.

84
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,620
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, the League Cup final is already considered something of a springboard for its winners, but this felt particularly so?

85
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:07,640
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

86
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,300
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it was so like, just an amazing thing in and of itself.

87
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,680
[SPEAKER_14]: That to me was more the thing.

88
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,920
[SPEAKER_14]: It didn't feel like necessarily it has to be a springboard.

89
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,800
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I think it's just said as a reflex.

90
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:26,580
[SPEAKER_14]: But if, say, like Chelsea had won it, then I think we say, you know, under Mareska, you know, he's come in, he's building something.

91
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,640
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was a springboard for Mourinho, of course.

92
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,500
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it definitely can be for them.

93
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:38,780
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not sure so, like, yeah, I'm not sure so much for this Newcastle team, because it feels like this is almost the culmination of a journey for them under Eddie Howe.

94
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,280
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, OK.

95
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,920
[SPEAKER_14]: It's my sense, anyway.

96
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,640
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's not the start of something new, then?

97
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:43,940
[SPEAKER_14]: Not sure it is.

98
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,960
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, there was some talk about it being a springboard on the broadcast yesterday.

99
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:58,260
[SPEAKER_15]: And there was one bit which I was up in arms when it was Shea Given was talking about this being a potential springboard.

100
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,800
[SPEAKER_15]: And it could have been a springboard for them two years ago.

101
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,460
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

102
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,960
[SPEAKER_15]: And sort of making the point, you know, managers go on, they win this, and they use it as a springboard.

103
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,280
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, Ten Hag won it two years ago.

104
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,280
[SPEAKER_15]: It didn't work out for him.

105
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,620
[SPEAKER_15]: It wasn't a springboard for him, was it?

106
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,580
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, in actual fact, I remember looking at this a few years ago.

107
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,200
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been the opposite of a springboard.

108
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:19,960
[SPEAKER_14]: And there was a thing I saw that I worked out, that, like, the manager who'd won it was sacked before the next League Cup final.

109
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,600
[SPEAKER_14]: For something like six years in a row, or six out of seven.

110
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,540
[SPEAKER_14]: You remember, like, Michael Laudrup at Swansea?

111
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,920
[SPEAKER_14]: He was gone.

112
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,800
[SPEAKER_14]: There were lots of them.

113
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,460
[SPEAKER_14]: It really didn't make any difference.

114
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,560
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, it was just kind of a moment.

115
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:36,140
[SPEAKER_15]: We've achieved the objective of saying the word springboard as many times as we could in the space of two minutes there.

116
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,980
[SPEAKER_15]: But good to bust the myth, at least.

117
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,960
[SPEAKER_15]: But you mentioned Mourinho there, Charlie.

118
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:49,280
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, before Mourinho won the League Cup against Liverpool in that game, was it ever talked about as being a springboard?

119
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,120
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that was the original springboard moment.

120
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,860
[SPEAKER_15]: And all of them have harked back to that since.

121
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,980
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's the one that's always cited.

122
00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:03,580
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, if you think that the previous year was won by Middlesbrough against Bolton in that complete sort of, like, random, you know, that was never...

123
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,500
[SPEAKER_14]: Although, I guess it nearly was a springboard because they nearly won the UEFA Cup, didn't they, a couple of years later?

124
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,400
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to Google it.

125
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,540
[SPEAKER_15]: Middlesbrough, Carling Cup, 2004, springboard.

126
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,620
[SPEAKER_15]: If there's one result, that's it.

127
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,200
[SPEAKER_15]: You're ruined.

128
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,040
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, there obviously will be, but...

129
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,340
[SPEAKER_15]: There will.

130
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:21,680
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, retrospectively, it might have been declared a springboard.

131
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,160
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

132
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,400
[SPEAKER_14]: For their UEFA Cup, right?

133
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,080
[SPEAKER_15]: No, no hint of springboard back in the day.

134
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:28,920
[SPEAKER_15]: So you're saved.

135
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:34,360
[SPEAKER_15]: But yeah, I think 2005 might well be the springboard for Carabao Cup springboarding.

136
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:39,420
[SPEAKER_15]: Lots of headlines today, Dave, about you try telling these fans that the Carabao Cup doesn't matter.

137
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,880
[SPEAKER_15]: So this was a slam dunk for the you try telling these fans.

138
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:48,320
[SPEAKER_15]: And there are still elements of the Carabao Cup that suggest it's not being taken super seriously.

139
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:55,900
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you tell me, or could you hazard a guess, at the last Carabao Cup final to feature both managers wearing a shirt and tie?

140
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,800
[SPEAKER_15]: It's become a very tracksuited affair.

141
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:04,040
[SPEAKER_15]: There's probably ones more recent, but I definitely think Big Sam and Steve McLaren would have been in shirt and tie for that final.

142
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,400
[SPEAKER_15]: I reckon they would have been.

143
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,200
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, sort of respecting it as Englishmen.

144
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,460
[SPEAKER_14]: Trying to think of...

145
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,520
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you know the answer, Adam?

146
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,220
[SPEAKER_14]: I do.

147
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,500
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm now looking up Allardyce, McLaren 2004, to be honest.

148
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,720
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, so it was likely before then?

149
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,460
[SPEAKER_15]: McLaren was in tracksuit, Allardyce was in shirt and tie.

150
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,680
[SPEAKER_15]: I can tell you it was after that.

151
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:32,980
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I'm thinking like the United Wigan one, Fergie and Paul Jewell, but then he doesn't feel particularly...

152
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,060
[SPEAKER_15]: Mourinho and Rafa?

153
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,380
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it's more recent than that.

154
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,940
[SPEAKER_15]: I can tell you it was 2016, Jurgen Klopp and Manuel Pellegrini.

155
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,540
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow, Jurgen Klopp in a suit.

156
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:54,980
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, Pellegrini was always a suitman anyway, so there was never any sense of him sort of dressing down, but yeah, Klopp was wearing a shirt, a tie, a jumper over the top, sort of Guardiola style, early Guardiola era style, and then a very nice coat over the top,

157
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,060
[SPEAKER_15]: so I'm allowing that.

158
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,240
[SPEAKER_15]: The tie is the crucial thing.

159
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:02,960
[SPEAKER_15]: Jacket, optional, but the last, you know, mutually tied Carabao Cup final.

160
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,060
[SPEAKER_15]: Disappointing.

161
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,220
[SPEAKER_15]: Charlie, I mean, what does this say about football culturally?

162
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:14,480
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it's evolving, sartorially speaking.

163
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,280
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you can just chuck Charlie anything and he'll answer it.

164
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,480
[SPEAKER_15]: No, not this time, but anyway, right.

165
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,100
[SPEAKER_15]: Next up, this came from Paulie Walnuts on Reddit, and I've got a sneaky supposition.

166
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,180
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought this at the time.

167
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:28,040
[SPEAKER_15]: Did Gary Neville read Peter Drury's line by mistake here?

168
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,860
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the boy from Blythe!

169
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,000
[SPEAKER_07]: A Wembley goal for the first time!

170
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,240
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, it's black and white, Bedlam.

171
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,800
[SPEAKER_15]: Nobody out-Bedlam's Peter Drury, Charlie.

172
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,060
[SPEAKER_14]: Black and white Bedlam.

173
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:57,460
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

174
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,260
[SPEAKER_15]: He's paid for Drury.

175
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,960
[SPEAKER_14]: Because there's Barovian Bedlam, isn't there, at Wembley?

176
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:01,440
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

177
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,160
[SPEAKER_15]: He's Bedlam'd quite a few times, Peter Drury.

178
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,020
[SPEAKER_15]: But yeah, it was just like doing a reading, Dave.

179
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,400
[SPEAKER_15]: You say, oh, no, sorry, that's your line, isn't it?

180
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:08,880
[SPEAKER_15]: Whoops, sorry.

181
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,520
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, look, you spend enough time with him, you're going to pick up some habits, aren't you, I guess?

182
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,020
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's true.

183
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,560
[SPEAKER_14]: It was this final last year, wasn't it?

184
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,620
[SPEAKER_14]: It was the blue billion-pound bottle jobs from Wembley.

185
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,500
[SPEAKER_14]: That's true, yeah.

186
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,760
[SPEAKER_14]: A tribute to that.

187
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,400
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, he's picking up a line or two.

188
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:21,700
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

189
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:34,920
[SPEAKER_15]: Many pointed out, including Lammy Pie on Reddit, Dave, that this could be the ultimate example of what a week he's having for Dan Byrne, winning your first, or getting your first England call-up and scoring in a cup final.

190
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,480
[SPEAKER_15]: Could that be the most what a week he's having possible?

191
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,240
[SPEAKER_15]: If he scores for England, that will really, really top it off, won't it?

192
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,520
[SPEAKER_15]: That's excessive, I think.

193
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,780
[SPEAKER_15]: That's too much.

194
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,720
[SPEAKER_15]: You can't have that.

195
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,320
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be an unprecedented week's had, wouldn't it, Charlie?

196
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,960
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we talked about it, I think, at the time, didn't we?

197
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,700
[SPEAKER_14]: It was because with the World Cup, because the last World Cup was sort of mid-season as well.

198
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:03,540
[SPEAKER_14]: That was an absolute, that was so ripe for, you know, what a week he's having or capping the sort of perfect week with a goal.

199
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:09,540
[SPEAKER_15]: Our Reddit users, Dave, were mulling over what kind of combination of things make up a what a week he's having.

200
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:17,760
[SPEAKER_15]: And they decided that it should be something on pitch and then something personal off pitch combining together to make their holistic existence going really well.

201
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:23,040
[SPEAKER_15]: Nick Ribb says, often used when the player scores after becoming a father for the first time.

202
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,480
[SPEAKER_15]: The Sunday League version for me was when I scored after completing on my flat.

203
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,620
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a big moment.

204
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,620
[SPEAKER_15]: What a week I've had.

205
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,800
[SPEAKER_15]: Because you'd only be able to declare it for yourself at Sunday League.

206
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,640
[SPEAKER_15]: Nobody else would know.

207
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,360
[SPEAKER_15]: What a week he's having, boys.

208
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,500
[SPEAKER_15]: Fresh from completing on his flat.

209
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,920
[SPEAKER_15]: I think, yeah.

210
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:47,320
[SPEAKER_15]: So, yeah, having a kid, Charlie, ideally your first one and scoring in a big game.

211
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,220
[SPEAKER_15]: I think those two, that could rival Dan Byrne's week.

212
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,560
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I saw a thing recently.

213
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,900
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it was on, I can't remember, it was like Sky Sports highlights.

214
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,340
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was like, birthday boy Ishmael Assar scores double or something.

215
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,100
[SPEAKER_14]: I was like, does that meet the threshold?

216
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,900
[SPEAKER_14]: You know your birthday's coming.

217
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,080
[SPEAKER_14]: So, it's a bit trivial, isn't it?

218
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,640
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that, how relevant is that?

219
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,760
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not sure having your...

220
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,200
[SPEAKER_14]: But I guess a great day for him.

221
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,660
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just not, yeah, maybe you can have the day.

222
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:15,820
[SPEAKER_15]: But yeah, you can't have your birthday just appearing in a week and saying, what a week it's been for me.

223
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,520
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, it's just, no, not really.

224
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,040
[SPEAKER_14]: Great party on Friday and then on Sunday, bagged a couple.

225
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,600
[SPEAKER_15]: Landmark, maybe, I don't know.

226
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,780
[SPEAKER_15]: Right, let's move over to the Champions League.

227
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
[SPEAKER_15]: Some action from last week.

228
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:31,880
[SPEAKER_15]: This is the start of the second half of extra time in the Champions League between Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid.

229
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:38,660
[SPEAKER_15]: And we've heard this phrase so often, but let's hear a hat-trick of it, in fact.

230
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,560
[SPEAKER_15]: Brahim Diaz has come on in this second half.

231
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:50,440
[SPEAKER_14]: Scored the goal, which seems a long time ago now, that put Madrid in front in the Bernabeu.

232
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,840
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the Conor Gallagher goal seems a long time ago, doesn't it?

233
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,760
[SPEAKER_15]: Vanessa's junior penalty feels a long time ago.

234
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:08,240
[SPEAKER_15]: The Russian dolls of this phrase here, Charlie, but the one right in the middle of Conor Gallagher's goal feeling a long time ago.

235
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,480
[SPEAKER_15]: It was literally 105 minutes before.

236
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:16,040
[SPEAKER_15]: So in the cliched use of that, it basically is actually quite a long time ago.

237
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:16,600
[SPEAKER_15]: Fair play.

238
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,540
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it is.

239
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,460
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it's longer than you sort of naturally expect for that.

240
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,100
[SPEAKER_14]: I still think it's sort of okay.

241
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,400
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not that long.

242
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,560
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that one is, I think that's an acceptable usage of it.

243
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:36,480
[SPEAKER_15]: Extra time quite crucial to the kind of formula here, Dave, because it adds that extra layer of things that happened a long time ago in a narrative sense in this game.

244
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:41,060
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, but would it work better if it was a 3-2 or something?

245
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,420
[SPEAKER_15]: And there'd been lots of incident since.

246
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,400
[SPEAKER_15]: It was still 1-0.

247
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:51,500
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, PiersM93 says, surely a goal being scored 105 minutes ago is objectively a long time ago.

248
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:56,000
[SPEAKER_15]: But then, Charlie, they threw the goal in the first leg into the mix, which was a week earlier.

249
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,480
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, a week is a long time in football.

250
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,880
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't start doing that.

251
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,440
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, yeah, that does feel like a long time ago.

252
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,080
[SPEAKER_14]: Loads has happened in the time since then.

253
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,220
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, too much time being juggled there.

254
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,140
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's stay in Europe.

255
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,180
[SPEAKER_15]: This next one came from Brad Jones, Dave.

256
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:17,700
[SPEAKER_15]: It's from the highlights of Bayern Munich's 1-1 draw at Union Berlin on Saturday, Kevin Hatchard and Stefan Freund on comms.

257
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:23,960
[SPEAKER_12]: Come loose here and the shot was hit really firmly by Uppamikano.

258
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:28,240
[SPEAKER_12]: That would have been a bit of a collector's item if that had flown into the top corner.

259
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,620
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, the Sunday goal on Saturday from Uppamikano.

260
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,360
[SPEAKER_15]: A Sunday goal?

261
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,620
[SPEAKER_15]: What's a Sunday goal?

262
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,280
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it just sounds like a phrase that they would use in Germany.

263
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,640
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought, I wonder what that means.

264
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:46,100
[SPEAKER_15]: So I got in touch with Kevin and I thought, so is Sunday goal a thing in Germany?

265
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:51,320
[SPEAKER_15]: And he says, yeah, it's like a worldie, the sort of thing you would try a million times and it never comes off.

266
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,080
[SPEAKER_15]: But for some reason, it always happens during the Sunday morning kick around.

267
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,540
[SPEAKER_15]: So a Sunday goal.

268
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,360
[SPEAKER_15]: But it was great to see the phrases colliding, Charlie.

269
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,300
[SPEAKER_15]: You had collector's item and then the other guy said, actually, no, it's more of a Sunday goal.

270
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,000
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, yeah.

271
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:08,120
[SPEAKER_14]: So would they say it would normally be in German compound and he's just trying to do English for us?

272
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,000
[SPEAKER_14]: I assume, yeah.

273
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:09,800
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, maybe.

274
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,660
[SPEAKER_15]: It must be.

275
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,440
[SPEAKER_15]: But I googled Sontag Tour and there was no reference to it.

276
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,680
[SPEAKER_15]: So God knows what's going on.

277
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,780
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe we've been hoodwinked.

278
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,420
[SPEAKER_15]: But I don't know.

279
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,980
[SPEAKER_15]: I've got Kevin Hatchard's number.

280
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,280
[SPEAKER_15]: Have you got Stefan Freund's number?

281
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:20,880
[SPEAKER_15]: Probably.

282
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:21,440
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

283
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,060
[SPEAKER_14]: It's probably there somewhere.

284
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:30,840
[SPEAKER_15]: Speaking of German phrases, it's not really a German phrase, but it was something from Tuchel's press conference the other day, which I really, I really enjoyed.

285
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:35,860
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like one of those phrases that's familiar to us, but they, you know, Europeans maybe just change it slightly.

286
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:43,520
[SPEAKER_15]: He was asked a question about how England were going to cope with the heat in America in the World Cup.

287
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:49,080
[SPEAKER_15]: And he sort of laughed and went, can we cross the bridge when we get to the river?

288
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,040
[SPEAKER_15]: Which I actually, I think is more elegant than we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.

289
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:59,560
[SPEAKER_15]: But yeah, yeah, a little bit less, less conversational, like really laying out the scenario you have in front of you.

290
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,000
[SPEAKER_15]: Some people might not have heard it before.

291
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:01,960
[SPEAKER_15]: Make it clear to them.

292
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:02,760
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, fine.

293
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,100
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

294
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:08,380
[SPEAKER_15]: I heard this during Leicester versus Manchester United on Sunday evening.

295
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,000
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's Don Goodman on the drought ending Rasmus Hoyland.

296
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,700
[SPEAKER_15]: Charlie, this just seems like something can just say about a player and did not have to back it up whatsoever.

297
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,700
[SPEAKER_15]: It feels like it could be quite streaky.

298
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,840
[SPEAKER_14]: A confidence player.

299
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:34,280
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

300
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,020
[SPEAKER_14]: It's funny.

301
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:45,340
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember, did you ever find, and I don't know if this still happens, but we were watching the boxing at uni and boxing always brings out, you know, people who, all of us know nothing about it, but you speak with a lot of authority.

302
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,260
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of like at the Olympics.

303
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:52,320
[SPEAKER_14]: And my friend who's a big one for that sort of thing was talking about, he was talking about Floyd Mayweather who's like, I think he's a real confidence fighter.

304
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,480
[SPEAKER_14]: I was just like, that is in my head.

305
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,040
[SPEAKER_14]: I was like, I'm really not sure he is.

306
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,880
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's such like a vague thing that you can sort of say about kind of anyone.

307
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,820
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is sort of the equivalent of that, of a striker, like, yeah, he's a real confidence striker.

308
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,080
[SPEAKER_14]: Have you got a nickname for him, like Contrary and Sam?

309
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:14,860
[SPEAKER_14]: Not, no, don't have a Contrary, not a Contrary Sam equivalent, but yeah, he was a big one for kind of bullshitting.

310
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,160
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, as we all are.

311
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:25,200
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, you often hear Dave about sort of pundits talking about strikers being streaky based on some evidence that they sort of held up, but announcing a player could be streaky.

312
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,160
[SPEAKER_15]: It just seems quite flimsy to me.

313
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,260
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like, well, what's that based on?

314
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,040
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's because he's gone a long time without a goal, is that it?

315
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:30,760
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

316
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:43,280
[SPEAKER_15]: I sort of do think he does have a little bit of the air of being a sort of confidence player, but maybe that just is because he's quite young and he's been a bit beleaguered of late and he took that goal really nicely.

317
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,500
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember Theo Walcott was a classic of that.

318
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,160
[SPEAKER_14]: He'd always be described as a real confidence player.

319
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:59,920
[SPEAKER_14]: The weird thing about him was that he wasn't, he was just incredibly inconsistent and he could be really out of form and then go through on goal and look like Thierry Henry, or he could have scored two in a game, go through on goal and an absolutely sky one.

320
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,060
[SPEAKER_14]: Like it really, I don't think it was to do with confidence.

321
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:05,600
[SPEAKER_14]: It was just the kind of thing that was said because he was quite erratic with his finishing.

322
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,400
[SPEAKER_15]: I think you're spot on.

323
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:11,280
[SPEAKER_15]: I think inconsistency just gets melded into this kind of, I can see into their mind kind of situation.

324
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:11,400
[SPEAKER_15]: Exactly.

325
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:11,840
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

326
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:15,060
[SPEAKER_15]: Makes it look far more sophisticated to call them a confidence player.

327
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,380
[SPEAKER_15]: Going to end part one with this from Fraser Clarke.

328
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:24,920
[SPEAKER_15]: He says he was watching Charlotte versus Cincinnati in MLS and around the 14 minute mark, Cincinnati had a chance, to which the commentator said this.

329
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:32,840
[SPEAKER_15]: Evander, quick trigger himself, Kalina makes the save, angle on the follow-up, all the way across, and Denke couldn't get an outstretched toe to it.

330
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,940
[SPEAKER_15]: Back and forth we go.

331
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,040
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think I've ever heard outstretched toe before.

332
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,440
[SPEAKER_15]: An outstretched toe.

333
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,180
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not going to make any difference, it's inside the boot.

334
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,000
[SPEAKER_15]: One toe, get your whole foot, if anything.

335
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,680
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, Fraser asks Dave, surely outstretched is reserved for legs only.

336
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,900
[SPEAKER_15]: Can a toe be outstretched?

337
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,260
[SPEAKER_15]: In fact, can any other body parts be outstretched?

338
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,100
[SPEAKER_15]: An outstretched neck?

339
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,380
[SPEAKER_15]: An outstretched arm?

340
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,140
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

341
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,700
[SPEAKER_15]: I suppose for a goalkeeper.

342
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,400
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, you talk about outstretched hand, don't you?

343
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,640
[SPEAKER_15]: Outstretched hand?

344
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:58,660
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure you hear that.

345
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,260
[SPEAKER_15]: Surely the arm is being stretched, at full stretch.

346
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,480
[SPEAKER_15]: The body, and then the arm, but I don't think I've ever heard stretched hand.

347
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,740
[SPEAKER_15]: For a goalkeeper, presumably.

348
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,840
[SPEAKER_15]: Outstretched hand, yeah.

349
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,260
[SPEAKER_15]: Outstretched hand?

350
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,340
[SPEAKER_15]: I've never imagined that.

351
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,720
[SPEAKER_15]: I suppose, yeah, spread your fingers.

352
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,760
[SPEAKER_15]: If only Gazza had outstretched his toe.

353
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,980
[SPEAKER_14]: That is a great example.

354
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,460
[SPEAKER_15]: Right then, that's the end of part one.

355
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,600
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll be back very shortly.

356
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:32,640
[SPEAKER_10]: At Sierra, discover great deals on top brand workout gear, like high-quality walking shoes, which might lead to another discovery.

357
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,620
[SPEAKER_09]: 40,000 steps, baby.

358
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,940
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's on top now, Karen?

359
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:40,060
[SPEAKER_10]: You've taken the office step challenge a step too far.

360
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,280
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't worry, though.

361
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,040
[SPEAKER_10]: Sierra also has yoga gear.

362
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,900

388
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,980
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome back to Football Clichés.

389
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,420
[SPEAKER_15]: This is the adjudication panel.

390
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,480
[SPEAKER_15]: This came from Matt on Reddit.

391
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,420
[SPEAKER_15]: It's superb.

392
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,880
[SPEAKER_15]: Wolves versus Everton the other week.

393
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:34,180
[SPEAKER_15]: And recent clichés quiz dark artsman Chris Wise on commentary.

394
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,400
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a happy art!

395
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,260
[SPEAKER_15]: Just wide of the post.

396
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,360
[SPEAKER_15]: Ooh, lovely little vibrato, wasn't it, Charlie?

397
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:41,940
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

398
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,640
[SPEAKER_14]: All of it gets shot away.

399
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:47,240
[SPEAKER_14]: I look forward to asking him who the subs were for Wolves in this game in a future quiz.

400
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,660
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I was pleased by this vibrato.

401
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:52,100
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't think it was strong enough to put in the clichés pod on its own.

402
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,660
[SPEAKER_15]: But then someone else sent me this.

403
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,300
[SPEAKER_15]: Joe Harbisher sent this in from BBC Radio 5 Live.

404
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,560
[SPEAKER_15]: Palace versus Millwall.

405
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,660
[SPEAKER_15]: Chris Wise also on duty for this.

406
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,340
[SPEAKER_15]: Munoz into the box for Palace and Ketia.

407
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,220
[SPEAKER_15]: And the shot held well.

408
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,720
[SPEAKER_15]: This is definitely his thing.

409
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,340
[SPEAKER_15]: So the only responsible thing to do at this point is put them together and see what it sounds like.

410
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,880
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a happy art!

411
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:12,920
[SPEAKER_15]: It's in Ketia.

412
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,100
[SPEAKER_15]: Wonderfully musical.

413
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,020
[SPEAKER_15]: What a voice.

414
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,300
[SPEAKER_15]: The singing commentator.

415
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,300
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, nice.

416
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,540
[SPEAKER_15]: Sounds like he's got some pipes.

417
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:21,220
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

418
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,420
[SPEAKER_15]: Vibrato, Chris Wise.

419
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:23,880
[SPEAKER_15]: Love it.

420
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,100
[SPEAKER_15]: Right, a quick footballer's names in things for you.

421
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,080
[SPEAKER_15]: This came from ExcellentPiglit on Reddit.

422
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:32,140
[SPEAKER_15]: Just what has the first ever Italian to play in the Premier League been up to since then?

423
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,040
[SPEAKER_09]: Back in 2018, I invited Andrea Salenzi to host the show for a bit.

424
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:46,220
[SPEAKER_09]: And while she was hosting, she made a three-part series we called The Single Lady's Guide to Sperm Shopping, or The Sperm Series for short.

425
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,320
[SPEAKER_14]: Busy guy!

426
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,120
[SPEAKER_14]: I look forward to the interview with him.

427
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:54,580
[SPEAKER_15]: Just using up his wages from Nottingham Forest, very wisely indeed.

428
00:22:54,980 --> 00:23:11,020
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, you mentioned Thomas Tuchel earlier on, Dave, and he eventually, in his first press conference, faced the inevitable question about the national anthem, a topic that plagued Lee Carsley's caretaker reign and threatens to overshadow Thomas Tuchel's right from the very start.

429
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,640
[SPEAKER_15]: But his response was incredible.

430
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:23,280
[SPEAKER_15]: He says, I will earn the right with results, with building a group, with doing my job properly, by creating a feeling where maybe even you guys in the media say at some point, now it's time that you sing it.

431
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:26,340
[SPEAKER_15]: It feels like you properly earned it, and you're a proper English guy now.

432
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:30,120
[SPEAKER_15]: This is a strategy I'd never considered to tackle this absurd question.

433
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:42,260
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's perfect because, one, it kicks this kind of fairly pathetic can all the way down the road, and two, it passes the responsibility back over to the England press back to make the decision for him, which is great, because now everyone will realise how ridiculous it is.

434
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,620
[SPEAKER_14]: You can declare it on the podcast, Dave.

435
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:45,280
[SPEAKER_14]: When will?

436
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,460
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, what is going to be, how many wins count?

437
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,420
[SPEAKER_14]: At what point did Sven earn the right, do you reckon?

438
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,940
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, after beating Germany, was that enough?

439
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:54,980
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess so.

440
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,420
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what we took him to our hearts.

441
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,060
[SPEAKER_14]: Surely he could have done after that.

442
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:58,600
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

443
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,280
[SPEAKER_14]: Did his accent start to slip?

444
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,500
[SPEAKER_14]: Did it get a bit more English?

445
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:02,200
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

446
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,040
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe.

447
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,900
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, I guess you just know it when you see it.

448
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,380
[SPEAKER_14]: There's not a threshold.

449
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,120
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe.

450
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:11,780
[SPEAKER_15]: So obviously not these two games coming up next week.

451
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,380
[SPEAKER_15]: And then there's some in June.

452
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,480
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think those.

453
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:19,380
[SPEAKER_15]: But then there'll be a big break until the next lot in the start of next season in September.

454
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,200
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, maybe that's the time to go with it.

455
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,120
[SPEAKER_14]: Did Capello ever?

456
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:28,940
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, did by qualifying for the World Cup and getting us back after not qualifying for the Euros, was that enough?

457
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,120
[SPEAKER_14]: But he was never really taken to the nation's hearts.

458
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,040
[SPEAKER_14]: I would suggest he'd never met Tuchel's kind of vague threshold here.

459
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:37,220
[SPEAKER_15]: But seriously, Charlie, I think this is a genius move from Tuchel.

460
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,720
[SPEAKER_15]: He's had a lot of time to think about it, clearly.

461
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,580
[SPEAKER_15]: And he's gone with this.

462
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,400
[SPEAKER_14]: Great news.

463
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,160
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe more managers will do it with sort of contentious issues.

464
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,740
[SPEAKER_14]: Be like, look, if you're so worried about it.

465
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,600
[SPEAKER_14]: You decide.

466
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,280
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

467
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,960
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll give it to you guys.

468
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:48,760
[SPEAKER_15]: I love it.

469
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,280
[SPEAKER_15]: I love it.

470
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53,080
[SPEAKER_15]: Who's going to actually say that then in the press conference?

471
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:54,440
[SPEAKER_15]: Crossy.

472
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:54,920
[SPEAKER_15]: Thomas.

473
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,600
[SPEAKER_15]: You've got to be crossy.

474
00:24:55,780 --> 00:25:01,620
[SPEAKER_14]: Wouldn't it be one of those awkward things like, oh man, you know, you've been here now 10 years and we just wanted to show you a little token of appreciation.

475
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:04,520
[SPEAKER_14]: Someone will kind of like side laugh at the end of the press conference.

476
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,820
[SPEAKER_14]: A framed sort of print of the lyrics.

477
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,300
[SPEAKER_15]: Citizenship test.

478
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:12,780
[SPEAKER_15]: Who knows?

479
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:20,100
[SPEAKER_15]: Tuchel also addressed the burning issue, Dave, of how he's been consuming his Premier League football, criticised in some quarters for not attending enough games.

480
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,060
[SPEAKER_15]: And he said that, yeah, don't worry.

481
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,700
[SPEAKER_15]: I also watch it from home in Germany.

482
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:30,960
[SPEAKER_15]: On the Premier League weekends where I don't go, I watch a minimum of five matches live on a wide angle screen.

483
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,600
[SPEAKER_15]: Incredible detail.

484
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:35,720
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like Eddie Howe saying he digitised all his training sessions.

485
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,080
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it's great.

486
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:41,560
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was funny watching Tuchel deal with that question, similar to the anthem stuff.

487
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,320
[SPEAKER_15]: Like he's very happy to get into it.

488
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:47,380
[SPEAKER_15]: And it does feel like he's rising above it quite well.

489
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,120
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, he is.

490
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,020
[SPEAKER_14]: But this is all such fodder, isn't it?

491
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:55,780
[SPEAKER_14]: For if and when it goes wrong, you know, the too much time in Munich, the not being in enough games, the national anthem.

492
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:01,800
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just so perfect for things that we have no real idea of how important they are, but they're good sticks to beat him with.

493
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:02,680
[SPEAKER_14]: But you're absolutely right.

494
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,540
[SPEAKER_15]: But he's treating it with just the right amount of disdain as well.

495
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:08,540
[SPEAKER_15]: He's not making anyone feel stupid for asking the questions.

496
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,620
[SPEAKER_15]: He's just batting them away really politely.

497
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,060
[SPEAKER_15]: I love his style so far.

498
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,280
[SPEAKER_14]: But he hasn't had results.

499
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,320
[SPEAKER_14]: Like that thing, it's one thing doing it now.

500
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:19,400
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, if results go badly, then this stuff becomes incredibly important.

501
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,600
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that's true.

502
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,920
[SPEAKER_15]: Lots of conjecture about his first England squad.

503
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:33,060
[SPEAKER_15]: And Jason Burton, The Telegraph, his piece was headlined, Tuchel abandons future by backing dad's army to deliver instant glory.

504
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:40,240
[SPEAKER_15]: Mark Ridley says, what's the threshold in terms of numbers and ages of players that are required to be labelled England's dad's army squad?

505
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,360
[SPEAKER_15]: This is nowhere close, surely.

506
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,960
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, Dan Byrne is in the graphic that they've used.

507
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,380
[SPEAKER_15]: That's his first call-up.

508
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,380
[SPEAKER_15]: It doesn't matter if he's 32.

509
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,240
[SPEAKER_15]: That doesn't count.

510
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:51,580
[SPEAKER_15]: And the other two are Henderson and Kyle Walker, right?

511
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:57,540
[SPEAKER_15]: And they're the only ones sort of deep into their mid-30s.

512
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:00,240
[SPEAKER_15]: He's called up Miles Lewis Skelly on the other end.

513
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:05,620
[SPEAKER_15]: The trouble with the dad's army sort of analogy, Charlie, is that the whole point of dad's army is that they were really inexperienced.

514
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,740
[SPEAKER_15]: They didn't know what they were doing.

515
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,940
[SPEAKER_14]: It is a great question.

516
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:16,140
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm trying to think of what is the kind of definitive dad's army football team or squad.

517
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,380
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think we've heard it enough, have we really?

518
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:17,700
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

519
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,340
[SPEAKER_14]: But it does get thrown around.

520
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:20,940
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm trying to think.

521
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,880
[SPEAKER_14]: There must have been a famous Premier League team that was a bit dad's army-ish and had lots of old players in.

522
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:26,640
[SPEAKER_14]: Or an international.

523
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:32,120
[SPEAKER_14]: Have England had one before, particularly, where we were playing sort of over-the-hill players?

524
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:35,660
[SPEAKER_14]: Capello, in 2010, went back to some experienced heads, didn't he?

525
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:39,380
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, brought back Carragher and Heskey.

526
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,780
[SPEAKER_15]: You can see that.

527
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,660
[SPEAKER_15]: Players being brought back out from the cold.

528
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:48,780
[SPEAKER_15]: So that only enhances the fact that they're old and seemingly over-the-hill in England terms.

529
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,260
[SPEAKER_15]: Might add to the dad's army nature.

530
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,080
[SPEAKER_14]: Fancy that, didn't they?

531
00:27:51,120 --> 00:28:02,120
[SPEAKER_14]: When they got to the World Cup 2006 final, they brought back Zidane, Churam, and one other kind of legendary player, all of whom had quit and then actually decided, nah, fuck it, we'll play the World Cup.

532
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:02,680
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

533
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,820
[SPEAKER_15]: What if they got the same accusation?

534
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,100
[SPEAKER_15]: What if there's a dad's army equivalent in France?

535
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,740
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, this next bit.

536
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,080
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.

537
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,060
[SPEAKER_15]: It came from Henry Robertshaw.

538
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:18,600
[SPEAKER_15]: Here is Doncaster Rovers manager Grant McCann reacting to his side's 1-1 draw at Crewe with an interview to BBC Radio.

539
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:27,240
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're hoping them decisions go your way and people say about swings and roundabouts, but I think we're on a lot of swings at the minute rather than roundabouts.

540
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,500
[SPEAKER_13]: So it just seems like nothing goes that way on those moments at this moment in time.

541
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,980
[SPEAKER_13]: That's definitely not how swings and roundabouts work.

542
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:40,120
[SPEAKER_15]: Unless I've been living a complete lie for the last four decades of my life, Charlie.

543
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,400
[SPEAKER_15]: Swings are just as good as roundabouts in this equation, right?

544
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,400
[SPEAKER_15]: They're not better than the other.

545
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,020
[SPEAKER_14]: They're one and the same.

546
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,520
[SPEAKER_14]: What's the equivalent expression he's looking for there?

547
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,420
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

548
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,300
[SPEAKER_14]: I just think swings are better than roundabouts.

549
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,000
[SPEAKER_14]: Swings good.

550
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:53,380
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

551
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,200
[SPEAKER_14]: Swings bad.

552
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,020
[SPEAKER_14]: Roundabouts good.

553
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,340
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I suppose...

554
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,840
[SPEAKER_14]: It seems like snakes and ladders or something.

555
00:28:59,200 --> 00:28:59,260
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

556
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,800
[SPEAKER_15]: Swings are more up and down, aren't they?

557
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,080
[SPEAKER_15]: The roundabout is just, you know, you're at the same level.

558
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:13,740
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you know, I was preparing to sort of dissect this for its absurdity on this podcast, Charlie, and I thought to myself, actually, what is it trying to evoke swings and roundabouts?

559
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,600
[SPEAKER_14]: We kind of know how to use it.

560
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,820
[SPEAKER_14]: We just don't know what it's evoking.

561
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:17,940
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it is a weird expression.

562
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:22,340
[SPEAKER_14]: And I remember, as ever, the first time I heard it, thinking like, what does that mean?

563
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,040
[SPEAKER_14]: And then finding out, and then I was like, why does it mean that?

564
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,440
[SPEAKER_14]: And are people just misusing it?

565
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,100
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it is quite an odd expression.

566
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:36,340
[SPEAKER_15]: The dictionary, Dave, says it's used to say that two choices or situations are basically the same because they have an equal number of advantages and disadvantages.

567
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,820
[SPEAKER_15]: So they're pretty balanced and it will all come out in the wash.

568
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,740
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to start using this from now on.

569
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:42,580
[SPEAKER_15]: That's it.

570
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:43,660
[SPEAKER_15]: Swings.

571
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,640
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't want them.

572
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:45,440
[SPEAKER_15]: Roundabouts.

573
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:45,820
[SPEAKER_15]: Definitely.

574
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:46,960
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm the other way round.

575
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,680
[SPEAKER_15]: Swings are better than roundabouts, I think, aren't they?

576
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,440
[SPEAKER_15]: All day long.

577
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,060
[SPEAKER_15]: All day long.

578
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:51,500
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, dizzy.

579
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,420
[SPEAKER_15]: Swings are great.

580
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,480
[SPEAKER_15]: Sort it out, Grant McCann.

581
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:57,060
[SPEAKER_15]: I was actually in a playground yesterday with my mate and his kids.

582
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,740
[SPEAKER_15]: And yeah, they were all about the swings.

583
00:29:59,160 --> 00:29:59,320
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

584
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,700
[SPEAKER_15]: Didn't want to know about the roundabouts.

585
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,260
[SPEAKER_15]: One go in a roundabout max.

586
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,340
[SPEAKER_15]: You're not going back to it.

587
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,120
[SPEAKER_15]: No chance.

588
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:05,440
[SPEAKER_15]: Seesaw?

589
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,120
[SPEAKER_15]: Not sure.

590
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,300
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe once.

591
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,760
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, swings are the go-to.

592
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,280
[SPEAKER_14]: Swings you can be on for bloody ages.

593
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,200
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, should we go?

594
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,200
[SPEAKER_15]: Right, final one for part two.

595
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,500
[SPEAKER_15]: This came from Joe Dawson.

596
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,880
[SPEAKER_15]: Leicester City tweeting during the game against Manchester United, Wilfred Ndidi in the engine room.

597
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,800
[SPEAKER_15]: And Joe Dawson says, can you be in the engine room as opposed to actually being the engine room?

598
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:33,220
[SPEAKER_15]: I've never conceived of the idea, Charlie, of the midfielders being the engine room.

599
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,200
[SPEAKER_15]: Surely they're just in it.

600
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,440
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I think they are in it.

601
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,000
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just a virtual situation.

602
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,140
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, you talk about them being in the engine room.

603
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:39,400
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

604
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,200
[SPEAKER_14]: They're not the engine room themselves.

605
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,240
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, spot on.

606
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:47,180
[SPEAKER_15]: They're in the engine room, shoveling the coal into the furnace, doing the hard work.

607
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,280
[SPEAKER_15]: So yeah, the engine room is just the area, right?

608
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,620
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, the sort of theater of war.

609
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,780
[SPEAKER_15]: Just the environment that they occupy.

610
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:54,200
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

611
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,820
[SPEAKER_15]: But yeah, sorry, Joe.

612
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,140
[SPEAKER_15]: Definitely not that.

613
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,080
[SPEAKER_15]: Right, that's the end of part two.

614
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,480
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll be back very shortly.

615
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,340

625

[SPEAKER_08]: They're selling your passwords, bank details, and private messages.

626
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,800

634
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Eczema isn't always obvious, but it's real.

635
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:12,660
[SPEAKER_06]: And so is the relief from Evglyss.

636
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:19,720
[SPEAKER_06]: After an initial dosing phase of 16 weeks, about 4 in 10 people taking Evglyss achieved itch relief and clear or almost clear skin.

637
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:24,020
[SPEAKER_06]: And most of those people maintain skin that's still more clear at one year with monthly dosing.

638
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:35,400
[SPEAKER_00]: Evglyss, Libri-Kizumab, LBKZ, a 250 milligram per two milliliter injection is a prescription medicine used to treat adults and children 12 years of age and older who weigh at least 88 pounds or 40 kilograms with moderate to severe eczema.

639
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:41,820
[SPEAKER_00]: Also called atopic dermatitis that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin or topicals or who cannot use topical therapies.

640
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,640
[SPEAKER_00]: Evglyss can be used with or without topical corticosteroids.

641
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,380
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't use if you're allergic to Evglyss.

642
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,440
[SPEAKER_00]: Allergic reactions can occur that can be severe.

643
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,480
[SPEAKER_00]: Eye problems can occur.

644
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,780
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell your doctor if you have new or worsening eye problems.

645
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,260
[SPEAKER_00]: You should not receive a live vaccine when treated with Evglyss.

646
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:57,440
[SPEAKER_00]: Before starting Evglyss, tell your doctor if you have a parasitic infection.

647
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,520
[SPEAKER_00]: Searching for real relief?

648
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:05,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Ask your doctor about Evglyss and visit evglyss.lily.com or call 1-800-Lily-RX or 1-800-545-5979.

649
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,940
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, look at that!

650
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:16,710
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome back to Football Clichés.

651
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:21,690
[SPEAKER_15]: This is the adjudication panel and a reminder that you can get in touch with footballcliches at gmail.com.

652
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:32,990
[SPEAKER_15]: You can DM me on Twitter or Instagram or get in touch and involved on our Reddit page which has hit 23,000 users which has brought us level with Skoda, Peugeot and Mercedes.

653
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:35,790
[SPEAKER_15]: We passed Rolls-Royce ages ago as well, Dave.

654
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:39,250
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're right up there with the giants of the automotive industry.

655
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:42,330
[SPEAKER_15]: Water Polo, Justin Bieber, surprisingly.

656
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:43,810
[SPEAKER_15]: I had to double check it.

657
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:45,710
[SPEAKER_15]: That was the number one page and it is.

658
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:47,150
[SPEAKER_15]: So, wow.

659
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:54,270
[SPEAKER_15]: Aberdeen, Bruce Lee, food allergies, lions, mountains and Florence and the Machine.

660
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:55,590
[SPEAKER_14]: Charlie, this is great.

661
00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:00,190
[SPEAKER_14]: Justin Bieber have as many or around the same number as each other.

662
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,950
[SPEAKER_14]: Justin Bieber, clearly not a Redditsman.

663
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:03,850
[SPEAKER_14]: He's not getting involved in the comments, is he?

664
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:04,390
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's face it.

665
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:07,470
[SPEAKER_15]: Right, there we go.

666
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,470
[SPEAKER_15]: Right, great developments.

667
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:13,350
[SPEAKER_15]: You'll be delighted to know in the generic football world.

668
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:15,550
[SPEAKER_15]: I spotted this on LinkedIn the other day.

669
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:30,010
[SPEAKER_15]: A guy called Will Brookwell has taken it upon himself to design a new football for the purposes of TV programmes, adverts, so that it can be used without, you know, brand considerations having to pay money and that sort of thing.

670
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:35,150
[SPEAKER_15]: So, the days of black and white hexagon footballs, Dave, are over.

671
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:36,110
[SPEAKER_15]: That's it.

672
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:43,170
[SPEAKER_15]: Will Brookwell has developed what he has called the shoot ball, the antidote to fake and unusable, unbranded football.

673
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:45,910
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been developed in three colourways as well.

674
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:47,870
[SPEAKER_15]: And what do you think about it?

675
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:48,690
[SPEAKER_15]: You're looking at it now.

676
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:51,530
[SPEAKER_15]: Does it look sort of authentically generic to you?

677
00:34:51,530 --> 00:35:02,290
[SPEAKER_15]: So, it's got like the classic panelling, but it's kind of like blue, wavy blue lines all over it, a couple of like triangles laid on top of each other at an angle.

678
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:05,430
[SPEAKER_15]: But it looks quite...

679
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:06,250
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I would...

680
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:09,270
[SPEAKER_15]: If you just show me that picture and you said, who makes this ball?

681
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:11,910
[SPEAKER_15]: It looks a bit like a modern mitre.

682
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:12,710
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

683
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:16,610
[SPEAKER_15]: The sort of ball you see in like the football league or the league cup.

684
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:19,210
[SPEAKER_15]: So, it's passing your eye test straight away, isn't it?

685
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:19,810
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

686
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:23,510
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it also does look a little bit like the cheapest ball you'd find in Sports Direct.

687
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:24,850
[SPEAKER_15]: Fair enough.

688
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:27,690
[SPEAKER_15]: That might be where the bar is set, Charlie, for this sort of thing.

689
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:29,370
[SPEAKER_15]: But some technical details for you.

690
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:30,310
[SPEAKER_15]: It's thermally bonded.

691
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:34,150
[SPEAKER_15]: You will be so glad to know because that's crucial to the authenticity.

692
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:38,230
[SPEAKER_15]: It's available in electric blue, infrared and white noise.

693
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:39,870
[SPEAKER_15]: They've nailed the colour schemes as well.

694
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:41,030
[SPEAKER_15]: So, it's all adding up.

695
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:41,930
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a great development.

696
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:43,030
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, good on him.

697
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:44,250
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, we've talked about this, haven't we?

698
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:48,810
[SPEAKER_14]: How irritating it is, the kind of inauthentic elements of football on film.

699
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:51,230
[SPEAKER_14]: So, yeah, that's power to the people.

700
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:53,190
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to do a kind of small talk equivalent.

701
00:35:53,650 --> 00:36:02,170
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't wait to see the first TV slash film production that it appears in and just how much that will be elevated by having the shoot ball involved.

702
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:04,870
[SPEAKER_15]: Next, this came via Jawain Sinclair.

703
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:13,470
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's Gordon Ramsay being interviewed by Instagram merchant Isaac Lykes on the London food scene and he saved some particularly footballing praise for the end.

704
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:16,350
[SPEAKER_12]: Ramsay, what is the best neighbourhood in London?

705
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:19,150
[SPEAKER_12]: Tootin, Balaam, Wandsworth.

706
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:20,710
[SPEAKER_12]: That's where I first started working for Marco.

707
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:21,550
[SPEAKER_12]: Best restaurants?

708
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:22,650
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, man.

709
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:24,250
[SPEAKER_12]: Give me as many as you want.

710
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:24,990
[SPEAKER_12]: Shea Bruce.

711
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:27,030
[SPEAKER_12]: Mountain in Soho, Gymkhana.

712
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:31,950
[SPEAKER_12]: To see Indian foods at the top of the chain with potentially three-star Michelin is just a joy.

713
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:34,870
[SPEAKER_12]: Trinity in Clapham, Alan Byatt, the guy is the real deal.

714
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:36,550
[SPEAKER_12]: First in, last out every day.

715
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:40,710
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the least I expect from a chef.

716
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:41,310
[SPEAKER_15]: I know.

717
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:42,250
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what they're famous for.

718
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:42,770
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

719
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:44,230
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, we're very sorry.

720
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:47,950
[SPEAKER_15]: The chef's actually left early today, so we've only got these dishes available.

721
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:50,130
[SPEAKER_15]: You never see him out on the pass, do you?

722
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:50,690
[SPEAKER_15]: There you go.

723
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:51,350
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

724
00:36:51,530 --> 00:37:03,570
[SPEAKER_15]: Next one came from Kimono Dragon amid the Canadian elections and the BBC were doing some Vox Pops saying we've been getting some reaction to Mark Carney's new cabinet from voters across the political spectrum.

725
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:06,250
[SPEAKER_15]: James Somowick is a liberal supporter from Quebec.

726
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:13,070
[SPEAKER_15]: He told the BBC World Service's OS programme that while an unconventional choice, he thinks Carney is a generational talent.

727
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:14,950
[SPEAKER_15]: That's absurd.

728
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:19,630
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't like generational talent at all anyway, Charlie, but I'm not having it for world leaders.

729
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:27,350
[SPEAKER_14]: It's quite funny as well because I think you'd expect to hear that about a kind of young and kind of prodigiously gifted politician.

730
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:34,150
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, like Barack Obama maybe when he was emerging I can sort of imagine his oratory is generational because it's so exciting.

731
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:35,250
[SPEAKER_14]: It's quite funny to talk about it.

732
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:37,010
[SPEAKER_14]: Mark Carney's 60s.

733
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:38,530
[SPEAKER_14]: He's been around the block.

734
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:39,550
[SPEAKER_14]: It's Dan Byrne.

735
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:40,290
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

736
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:41,710
[SPEAKER_14]: Dad's army over in Canada.

737
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:43,190
[SPEAKER_14]: He was the governor of the Bank of England, wasn't he?

738
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:47,890
[SPEAKER_15]: So he's had two high profile political jobs in two different countries.

739
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:48,890
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

740
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:49,630
[SPEAKER_15]: I think he could be.

741
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:52,390
[SPEAKER_15]: Knows a thing or two about that sort of thing.

742
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:58,750
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, a great weekend for the XYZ headline format but who did it better?

743
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:02,590
[SPEAKER_15]: Lewis Hamilton has started the season at Ferrari his new team.

744
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:05,990
[SPEAKER_15]: The Athletic, Charlie, went for Lewis Hamilton's first week at Ferrari.

745
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:09,690
[SPEAKER_15]: Louboutin boots, a dream fulfilled and a proud mum.

746
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:16,490
[SPEAKER_15]: The Times, inside Lewis Hamilton's first weeks at Ferrari, mountain hikes, oat milk lattes and proud mum pics.

747
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:23,230
[SPEAKER_15]: And the Telegraph, Lewis Hamilton's new life at Ferrari, vegan pizza, Italian lessons and living in a motorhome.

748
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:24,730
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

749
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:28,690
[SPEAKER_14]: So to pick these apart, I think the Athletic one is slightly different.

750
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:41,790
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't, like the Times and Telegraph are the absolute archetypes because they've got food stuff, they've got an activity and then they've got a kind of slightly vague we're running out of steam third one.

751
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:48,290
[SPEAKER_14]: So, like, living in a motorhome is just quite factual, I suppose.

752
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:58,890
[SPEAKER_14]: Proud mum pics is maybe a bit more conceptual, but yeah, so I think the pizza, although actually the fact that mountain hikes is a better one, I think, than Italian lessons.

753
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:01,010
[SPEAKER_14]: That's an exercise regime and you want it in there, don't you?

754
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:04,530
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, because that's more of an activity.

755
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:07,670
[SPEAKER_14]: But like, both have food, which is key.

756
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:11,030
[SPEAKER_14]: So yeah, I think Times and Telegraph are pretty textbook.

757
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:18,030
[SPEAKER_14]: The Athletic one feels it's like a little more featurey than kind of like a dream fulfilled and a proud mum.

758
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:20,730
[SPEAKER_14]: Those aren't your classic kind of things.

759
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:22,990
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, they're not picking up on curious details.

760
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:25,290
[SPEAKER_15]: What have the boots got to do with anything?

761
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,770
[SPEAKER_15]: Nobody knows, you've got to read the piece to find out.

762
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:28,270
[SPEAKER_15]: Subscribe.

763
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:32,810
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, no, the boots are perfect because yeah, they're sort of like, yeah, what's that about?

764
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:36,890
[SPEAKER_15]: Right then, we thought Keys and Grey Corner was a long forgotten concept.

765
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:40,070
[SPEAKER_15]: It roared back last week and it's back again.

766
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:57,030
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's back again.

767
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:59,530
[SPEAKER_15]: A little duo for you for Keys and Grey.

768
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:04,050
[SPEAKER_15]: First one came from Dave Martin, Popmaster, with Ken Bruce on Thursday.

769
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:14,010
[SPEAKER_13]: So on the line to us now is Andy Gray from the Isle of Sheppey.

770
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:14,550
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello, Andy.

771
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:16,110
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello, Ken.

772
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:16,590
[SPEAKER_13]: You all right?

773
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:17,250
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I'm good.

774
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:17,750
[SPEAKER_15]: How about you?

775
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:20,490
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the simple pleasures, isn't it?

776
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:21,330
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, God.

777
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:25,350
[SPEAKER_15]: It's nice to see Ken Bruce popping up in Keys and Grey Corner.

778
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,750
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, what a crossover.

779
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:31,170
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, just no hint that he might have recognised the name at all.

780
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:33,550
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, but yeah, great to hear the name.

781
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:35,310
[SPEAKER_15]: And now, here we go.

782
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:42,890
[SPEAKER_15]: James Hines, Charlie, sent me a tweet from a fuming punter after the chaotic starts to some of the races at Cheltenham last week.

783
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:47,390
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, it was a brilliant tweet in its own right, but there was something so keysy about it.

784
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:48,790
[SPEAKER_15]: So I didn't want to just read it out.

785
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:56,570
[SPEAKER_15]: I stuck it in the AI, turned it into Keysy's voice, and here it is, Richard Keys complaining about the starters at Cheltenham.

786
00:40:56,890 --> 00:41:02,970
[SPEAKER_13]: Sick to death of this incompetent buffoon ruining so many races.

787
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:11,330
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, he shouldn't be in charge of a hamster, let alone the equine thoroughbred.

788
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:15,570
[SPEAKER_13]: It's keysy perfection.

789
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:16,630
[SPEAKER_14]: That is superb.

790
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:17,710
[SPEAKER_14]: It's perfect.

791
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:23,450
[SPEAKER_14]: God, the AI, how it got the breathiness to express indignation.

792
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:24,070
[SPEAKER_14]: Amazing.

793
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:26,530
[SPEAKER_14]: I used some very recent keys for that.

794
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:27,370
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, yeah.

795
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:34,250
[SPEAKER_15]: And there are some sliders that you can use on the AI thing, and you can turn, you can make the style exaggerated, so I pushed it right up.

796
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:40,130
[SPEAKER_15]: But the only thing is there's no button you can press stay for it to linger on certain words, which is quite annoying.

797
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:41,070
[SPEAKER_15]: Buffoon.

798
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:42,810
[SPEAKER_15]: Tremendous.

799
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:43,390
[SPEAKER_15]: There he is.

800
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:44,910
[SPEAKER_15]: Really brought it to life.

801
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:48,650
[SPEAKER_15]: But this isn't keys and gray related, but it is related to horse racing.

802
00:41:49,170 --> 00:42:05,130
[SPEAKER_15]: Finally today, at Cheltenham, this came from Trevor Mack on Reddit, horse racing enthusiast Michael Harris tweeted, horses will not always perform at their optimum, and when they don't, they are unfairly crucified on X, such is the nature of this platform.

803
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:13,530
[SPEAKER_15]: I just feel that Caldwell Potter, Bob Ollinger, and Fact to File have silenced a few today, and will be having a wry smile in their staples tonight.

804
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:17,790
[SPEAKER_15]: Imagine a horse doing a wry smile.

805
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:23,610
[SPEAKER_15]: Could a horse get its hoof up to its mouth and do the old shush thing thing?

806
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:29,290
[SPEAKER_15]: My God, people take horse racing so seriously that this is incredible.

807
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:33,970
[SPEAKER_15]: A little wry smile in their staples before my God.

808
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:36,610
[SPEAKER_15]: A raised eyebrow or two.

809
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:39,150
[SPEAKER_15]: Shushing, shushing the punters.

810
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:40,990
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, thanks to you Charlie Eccleshare.

811
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:42,310
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

812
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:43,470
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks to you Dave Walker.

813
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:44,270
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:45,570
